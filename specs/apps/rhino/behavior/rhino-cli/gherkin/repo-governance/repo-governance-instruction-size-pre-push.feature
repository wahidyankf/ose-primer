Feature: Pre-push enforcement of the instruction-file size budget

  As a repository maintainer
  I want the pre-push hook to block pushes that put an instruction file over budget
  So that over-budget surfaces never land on the shared branch

  Scenario: Pushing an over-budget instruction file is blocked
    Given my push range modifies "AGENTS.md"
    And "AGENTS.md" exceeds its fail ceiling
    When the pre-push hook runs
    Then the instruction-size validation Nx target runs
    And the push is aborted with a non-zero exit

  Scenario: Pushing changes that do not touch instruction files skips the gate
    Given my push range modifies only "apps/ose-www/src/page.tsx"
    When the pre-push hook runs
    Then the instruction-size validation target is not invoked

  Scenario: Pushing an in-budget instruction-file edit passes
    Given my push range modifies "AGENTS.md"
    And "AGENTS.md" is within its fail ceiling
    When the pre-push hook runs
    Then the instruction-size validation target runs and exits 0
    And the push proceeds
