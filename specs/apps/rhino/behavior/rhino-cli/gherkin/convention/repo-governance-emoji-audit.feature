Feature: Governance Emoji Audit

  As a repository maintainer
  I want to scan forbidden file types for emoji codepoints
  So that source code and config files stay emoji-free per the Emoji Convention

  Scenario: Clean source tree passes
    Given a source tree containing no emoji codepoints in forbidden file types
    When the developer runs convention emoji validate on the tree
    Then the command exits successfully
    And the output reports zero emoji findings

  Scenario: Emoji codepoint in a JSON file fails
    Given a JSON file containing an emoji codepoint
    When the developer runs convention emoji validate on the file
    Then the command exits with a failure code
    And the output identifies the offending file line and codepoint

  Scenario: Emoji codepoint in a Go source file fails
    Given a Go source file containing an emoji codepoint
    When the developer runs convention emoji validate on the file
    Then the command exits with a failure code
    And the output identifies the offending file line and codepoint

  Scenario: Multibyte non-emoji unicode does not trigger a finding
    Given a forbidden file containing multibyte non-emoji unicode such as Arabic
    When the developer runs convention emoji validate on the file
    Then the command exits successfully
    And the output reports zero emoji findings

  Scenario: emoji-audit skips archived directory
    Given a source tree with an emoji-containing file inside the archived directory
    When the developer runs convention emoji validate on the tree
    Then the command exits successfully
    And the output reports zero emoji findings
