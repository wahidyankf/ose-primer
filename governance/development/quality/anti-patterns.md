# Anti-Patterns in Quality Development

> **Companion Document**: For positive guidance on what to do, see [Best Practices](./best-practices.md)

## Overview

Understanding common mistakes in quality development helps teams build more reliable, maintainable, and consistent codebases. These anti-patterns cause quality issues, technical debt, and maintenance burden.

## Purpose

This document provides:

- Common anti-patterns in quality development
- Examples of problematic implementations
- Solutions and corrections for each anti-pattern
- Quality and maintenance considerations

## ❌ Common Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: Manual Quality Checks

**Problem**: Relying on developers to remember quality checks.

**Bad Example:**

```bash
# Developer's manual workflow (error-prone)
# 1. Write code
# 2. Manually run prettier (sometimes forgotten)
# 3. Manually run eslint (sometimes forgotten)
# 4. Commit (with inconsistent formatting!)
```

**Solution:**

```json
// package.json - Automated hooks
{
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{ts,js}": ["prettier --write", "eslint --fix"]
  }
}
```

**Rationale:**

- Manual checks are forgotten
- Inconsistent code quality
- Wastes code review time
- Automation is reliable

### Anti-Pattern 2: No Issue Prioritization

**Problem**: Treating all findings as equally important.

**Bad Example:**

```markdown
## All Issues (43)

1. Broken authentication (CRITICAL!)
2. Missing alt text
3. Extra whitespace
   ...
4. Optional code cleanup
   (No categorization - what to fix first?)
```

**Solution:**

```markdown
## CRITICAL Issues (1)

- Broken authentication endpoint

## HIGH Issues (8)

- Missing alt text on images

## MEDIUM Issues (15)

- Style inconsistencies

## LOW Issues (19)

- Optional improvements
```

**Rationale:**

- Critical issues need immediate attention
- Clear prioritization
- Efficient resource allocation
- Business impact visibility

### Anti-Pattern 3: Applying Fixes Without Confidence Assessment

**Problem**: Automated fixer applies all fixes without validation.

**Bad Example:**

```bash
# Blind fixes (DO NOT DO THIS)
for finding in $(cat audit.md); do
  apply_fix "$finding"  # No validation!
done
```

**Solution:**

```bash
# Re-validate and assess confidence
for finding in $FINDINGS; do
  if revalidate "$finding"; then
    confidence=$(assess_confidence "$finding")
    if [ "$confidence" = "HIGH" ]; then
      apply_fix "$finding"
    fi
  fi
done
```

**Rationale:**

- Prevents incorrect automated changes
- Validates finding still exists
- Requires human judgment for uncertainty
- Safe remediation

### Anti-Pattern 4: Deleting Content Without Preservation

**Problem**: Removing files during refactoring without saving knowledge.

**Bad Example:**

```bash
# Delete old docs (DO NOT DO THIS)
rm old-architecture.md
rm legacy-api-docs.md
rm deprecated-guide.md
# Knowledge lost forever!
```

**Solution:**

```markdown
## Refactoring Process

1. Read all old docs thoroughly
2. Extract unique knowledge
3. Migrate to new structure
4. Archive originals (not delete)
5. Verify no knowledge lost
```

**Rationale:**

- Documentation is valuable
- Knowledge preserved
- Can reference later
- Respects Documentation First principle

### Anti-Pattern 5: Running All Tests in Pre-Push

**Problem**: Pre-push hook runs the entire test suite or uses non-standard target names (slow, and breaks workspace-level automation).

**Note**: `test:integration` and `test:e2e` must never be included in `test:quick`. See [Three-Level Testing Standard](./three-level-testing-standard.md) for which test level runs where.

**Bad Example:**

```bash
# .husky/pre-push
nx test  # Runs ALL tests (5+ minutes!) with non-standard target name
# Developers skip hook due to slowness
```

**Solution:**

```bash
# .husky/pre-push
nx affected -t test:quick
# Only affected projects, fast quality gate target (seconds to a few minutes)
```

**Rationale:**

- Fast feedback encourages usage
- Runs only relevant projects (Nx affected detection)
- `test:quick` is the canonical pre-push gate — every project must expose it
- Prevents hook bypass
- Maintains quality gate

**See**: [Nx Target Standards](../infra/nx-targets.md) for `test:quick` composition rules per project type.

### Anti-Pattern 6: Ad-Hoc Validation Logic

**Problem**: Each validator implements different patterns.

**Bad Example:**

```bash
# Validator 1
grep -E "pattern" file

# Validator 2
awk '{print $1}' file | some_command

# Validator 3
python custom_script.py file

# No consistency, hard to maintain
```

**Solution:**

```bash
# Standardized validation pattern
validate_field() {
  local file=$1
  local field=$2
  # Standard extraction and validation
  # Consistent error reporting
  # Reusable across validators
}
```

**Rationale:**

- Consistent validation patterns
- Easier to maintain
- Reduces duplication
- Clear methodology

### Anti-Pattern 7: Ignoring Criticality in Fix Execution

**Problem**: Fixing issues in random order instead of priority.

**Bad Example:**

```bash
# Random fix order (DO NOT DO THIS)
for file in $(ls); do
  fix_issues "$file"  # Low priority might be fixed before critical!
done
```

**Solution:**

```bash
# Priority-based execution
fix_p0_blockers()      # CRITICAL + HIGH confidence
fix_p1_urgent()        # HIGH + HIGH confidence
fix_p2_normal()        # MEDIUM + HIGH confidence
# P3-P4 are suggestions only
```

**Rationale:**

- Blockers fixed first
- Efficient resource use
- Clear escalation
- Business impact aligned

### Anti-Pattern 8: No Quality Gates in CI

**Problem**: CI passes even with quality violations, or uses non-standard target names that bypass workspace-level automation.

**Bad Example:**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
- name: Lint
  run: npm run lint || true # Always passes!

- name: Test
  run: npm test || echo "Tests failed, but continuing..."
```

**Solution:**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
- name: Lint
  run: nx affected -t lint

- name: Quick Tests (required status check before PR merge)
  run: nx affected -t test:quick
```

**Rationale:**

- Quality gate enforcement
- `test:quick` is the required GitHub Actions status check before PR merge
- Prevents bad code merging
- Team accountability
- Maintains codebase health

**See**: [Nx Target Standards](../infra/nx-targets.md) for the full execution model and CI integration rules.

### Anti-Pattern 9: Undocumented Validation Rules

**Problem**: Validation rules exist without explanation.

**Bad Example:**

```bash
# Validator
if ! validate_rule_x "$file"; then
  echo "Validation failed"  # Why? What's rule X?
fi
```

**Solution:**

```markdown
## Validation: Rule X - Alt Text Required

**Rule**: All images must have descriptive alt text.

**Rationale**:

- WCAG AA compliance
- Screen reader accessibility
- SEO benefits

**Example**: `<img src="photo.jpg" alt="Description" />`
```

**Rationale:**

- Clear purpose and context
- Easier to maintain
- Educational for team
- Enables informed decisions

### Anti-Pattern 10: Formatting Entire Repo on Every Commit

**Problem**: Pre-commit hook formats all files, not just staged.

**Bad Example:**

```bash
# .husky/pre-commit
prettier --write .  # Formats ALL files (slow!)
git add .           # Stages unintended changes!
```

**Solution:**

```json
// package.json
{
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.md": ["prettier --write"]
  }
}
```

**Rationale:**

- Fast pre-commit (only staged files)
- No unintended changes
- Gradual quality improvement
- Developer-friendly

### Anti-Pattern 11: Mixing Test Levels

**Problem**: Using HTTP dispatch in integration tests, or using a real database in unit tests, conflating what each level is meant to verify.

**Bad Example:**

```java
// Integration test using MockMvc (HTTP layer — wrong for integration level)
@Test
void createProduct() {
    mockMvc.perform(post("/api/products")
        .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
        .content(json))
        .andExpect(status().isCreated()); // HTTP dispatch — belongs in E2E!
}
```

**Solution:**

```java
// Integration test calling service directly with real database (correct)
@Test
void createProduct() {
    var result = productService.create(productData, realRepo); // direct call
    assertThat(result.isSuccess()).isTrue();
}
```

**Rationale:**

- Integration tests verify persistence and transactions, not HTTP routing
- HTTP contract is verified at E2E level with Playwright
- Mixing levels obscures which concern fails when a test breaks
- Real databases in unit tests make them slow, non-deterministic, and uncacheable

**See**: [Three-Level Testing Standard](./three-level-testing-standard.md) for the full level definitions and boundaries.
