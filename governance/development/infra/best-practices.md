# Best Practices for Infrastructure Development

> **Companion Document**: For common mistakes to avoid, see [Anti-Patterns](./anti-patterns.md)

## Overview

This document outlines best practices for managing development infrastructure, including temporary files, build artifacts, and acceptance criteria. Following these practices ensures organized, traceable, and testable development processes.

## Purpose

Provide actionable guidance for:

- Temporary file organization
- Report generation and tracking
- Acceptance criteria authoring
- Build artifact management
- Development infrastructure patterns

## ✅ Best Practices

### Practice 1: Use Designated Temporary Directories

**Principle**: All temporary files go in `generated-reports/` or `local-temp/`, never repository root.

**Good Example:**

```bash
# Validation report
generated-reports/docs__a1b2c3__2025-12-14--20-45__audit.md

# Scratch work
local-temp/draft-analysis.txt
```

**Bad Example:**

```bash
# Scattered temporary files (DO NOT DO THIS)
temp-report.md
validation-output.txt
analysis-2025-12-14.json
```

**Rationale:**

- Clear organization prevents clutter
- Easy cleanup (both gitignored)
- Predictable file locations
- Separates temporary from permanent content

### Practice 2: Follow Standardized Report Naming

**Principle**: Use 4-part pattern: `{agent-family}__{uuid-chain}__{timestamp}__{type}.md`

**Good Example:**

```bash
# Generate UUID and timestamp
UUID=$(uuidgen | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | head -c 6)
TIMESTAMP=$(TZ='Asia/Jakarta' date +"%Y-%m-%d--%H-%M")

# Create report
REPORT="generated-reports/docs__${UUID}__${TIMESTAMP}__audit.md"
```

**Bad Example:**

```bash
# Placeholder values (DO NOT DO THIS)
REPORT="generated-reports/docs__abc123__2025-12-14--00-00__audit.md"
```

**Rationale:**

- Unique UUIDs prevent file collisions
- Accurate timestamps enable chronological sorting
- Standardized pattern aids automation
- Audit trail for all validation runs

### Practice 3: Write Reports Progressively

**Principle**: Update report files continuously during execution, not at the end.

**Good Example:**

```bash
# Initialize report immediately
echo "# Audit Report" > "$REPORT"
echo "**Status**: In Progress" >> "$REPORT"

# Write findings as discovered
for file in $FILES; do
  result=$(validate "$file")
  echo "## $file" >> "$REPORT"
  echo "Result: $result" >> "$REPORT"
done

# Update final status
sed -i 's/In Progress/Complete/' "$REPORT"
```

**Bad Example:**

```bash
# Buffer in memory (DO NOT DO THIS)
findings=""
for file in $FILES; do
  findings+="$(validate "$file")\n"
done

# Write at end (lost if context compacted!)
echo "$findings" > "$REPORT"
```

**Rationale:**

- Survives context compaction during long audits
- Provides real-time progress visibility
- Enables debugging of incomplete runs
- Critical for AI agent reliability

### Practice 4: Generate Real UUIDs and Timestamps

**Principle**: Execute bash commands for actual values, never use placeholders.

**Good Example:**

```bash
# Generate real UUID
UUID=$(uuidgen | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | head -c 6)
# Example output: a1b2c3

# Generate current timestamp
TIMESTAMP=$(TZ='Asia/Jakarta' date +"%Y-%m-%d--%H-%M")
# Example output: 2025-12-14--16-43
```

**Bad Example:**

```bash
# Placeholder values (DO NOT DO THIS)
UUID="abc123"
TIMESTAMP="2025-12-14--00-00"
```

**Rationale:**

- Unique UUIDs prevent parallel execution collisions
- Accurate timestamps enable audit trails
- Debugging requires real creation times
- Placeholders defeat the purpose of tracking

### Practice 5: Use Scope-Based Execution Tracking

**Principle**: Track execution chains within scopes to handle concurrent workflows.

**Good Example:**

```bash
# Determine scope
SCOPE="${EXECUTION_SCOPE:-docs}"

# Read parent chain from scope-specific file
CHAIN_FILE="generated-reports/.execution-chain-${SCOPE}"
if [ -f "$CHAIN_FILE" ]; then
  read PARENT_TIME PARENT_CHAIN < "$CHAIN_FILE"
  TIME_DIFF=$(($(date +%s) - PARENT_TIME))

  if [ $TIME_DIFF -lt 30 ]; then
    UUID_CHAIN="${PARENT_CHAIN}_${MY_UUID}"
  else
    UUID_CHAIN="${MY_UUID}"
  fi
else
  UUID_CHAIN="${MY_UUID}"
fi
```

**Bad Example:**

```bash
# Global tracking file (causes race conditions)
CHAIN_FILE="generated-reports/.execution-chain"
# All workflows share same file - parent tracking breaks!
```

**Rationale:**

- Isolates concurrent workflow executions
- Prevents cross-contamination between scopes
- Enables accurate parent-child hierarchy
- Handles parallel execution correctly

### Practice 6: Write Gherkin Acceptance Criteria

**Principle**: Use Given-When-Then format for testable requirements.

**Good Example:**

```gherkin
Scenario: User logs in with valid credentials
  Given a registered user with email "user@example.com"
  When the user submits login form with correct password
  Then the user is redirected to dashboard
  And a session token is created
```

**Bad Example:**

```markdown
The system should allow users to log in.
```

**Rationale:**

- Testable and executable specifications
- Clear setup, action, and expected outcome
- Enables automated testing
- Reduces ambiguity in requirements

### Practice 7: Require Write and Bash Tools for Report Generators

**Principle**: Checker agents MUST have both Write and Bash tools in frontmatter.

**Good Example:**

```yaml
---
name: docs-checker
description: Validates documentation quality
tools: [Read, Glob, Grep, Write, Bash]
model: sonnet
---
```

**Bad Example:**

```yaml
---
name: docs-checker
description: Validates documentation quality
tools: [Read, Glob, Grep] # MISSING Write and Bash!
---
```

**Rationale:**

- Write tool creates report files
- Bash tool generates UTC+7 timestamps
- Mandatory for audit report generation
- Consistency across all checker agents

### Practice 8: Pair Audit and Fix Reports with Same UUID and Timestamp

**Principle**: Fixer reports use same UUID-chain and timestamp as source audit.

**Good Example:**

```bash
# Audit report
AUDIT="generated-reports/docs__a1b2c3__2025-12-14--20-45__audit.md"

# Fix report (same UUID and timestamp)
FIX="generated-reports/docs__a1b2c3__2025-12-14--20-45__fix.md"
```

**Bad Example:**

```bash
# Fix report with new timestamp (DO NOT DO THIS)
FIX="generated-reports/docs__d4e5f6__2025-12-14--21-00__fix.md"
# Can't match to source audit!
```

**Rationale:**

- Clear audit-fix traceability
- Enables exact report matching
- Supports debugging and review
- Maintains complete audit trail

### Practice 9: Clean Up Temporary Files Periodically

**Principle**: Remove old temporary files to prevent accumulation.

**Good Example:**

```bash
# Archive old reports (>30 days)
find generated-reports/ -name "*.md" -mtime +30 -exec mv {} archive/ \;

# Clean scratch files (>7 days)
find local-temp/ -mtime +7 -delete
```

**Bad Example:**

```bash
# Never clean up (thousands of old files accumulate)
```

**Rationale:**

- Prevents directory bloat
- Faster file system operations
- Easier to find recent reports
- Maintains workspace hygiene

### Practice 10: Document Temporary File Purposes

**Principle**: Add README or comments explaining long-lived temporary files.

**Good Example:**

```bash
# local-temp/cache/README.md
# Performance Cache
#
# This directory contains cached API responses for development.
# Files are regenerated automatically if older than 1 hour.
# Safe to delete - will be recreated as needed.
```

**Bad Example:**

```bash
# Mysterious temporary files with no explanation
local-temp/data-2025.json
local-temp/cache-v3.bin
local-temp/temp-final-v2.txt
```

**Rationale:**

- Clear purpose reduces confusion
- Easier onboarding for new team members
- Prevents accidental deletion of important data
- Documents retention policies
