# Plan Workflows

Orchestrated workflows for project planning quality validation and systematic execution.

## Purpose

These workflows define **WHEN and HOW to validate and execute plans**, orchestrating plan-checker, plan-fixer, plan-executor, and plan-execution-checker agents in sequence to ensure plan quality and systematic implementation.

## Scope

**✅ Workflows Here:**

- Plan quality validation
- Plan execution tracking
- Iterative plan improvement
- Multi-agent orchestration for plans/
- Check-fix-verify and execution cycles

**❌ Not Included:**

- Content quality validation (that's docs/)
- Hugo content validation (that's ayokoding-fs/)
- Single-agent operations (use agents directly)

## Workflows

- [Plan Execution](./plan-execution.md) - Execute plan tasks systematically with validation and completion tracking using plan-executor and plan-execution-checker
- [Plan Quality Gate](./plan-quality-gate.md) - Validate plan completeness and accuracy, apply fixes iteratively until ZERO findings using plan-checker and plan-fixer
