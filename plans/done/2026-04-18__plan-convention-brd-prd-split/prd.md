# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Plan**: Plan Convention — Split Requirements into BRD + PRD
**Date**: 2026-04-18

## Product Overview

Evolve the canonical plan structure from four documents (`README.md`, `requirements.md`, `tech-docs.md`, `delivery.md`) to five documents (`README.md`, `brd.md`, `prd.md`, `tech-docs.md`, `delivery.md`) across the Plans Organization Convention, four plan agents, one skill, cross-referenced governance docs, and one active in-progress plan.

## Personas

> This is a single-maintainer repo collaborating with AI agents. "Personas" below are hats the maintainer wears plus the agents that consume plan files. There is no external sponsor or external product owner role; code review is the approval gate.

| Persona                                    | Primary file(s)               | Need                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Maintainer (author, intent mode)           | `brd.md`                      | Capture the "why" and success metrics without tangling them with product scope                |
| Maintainer (author, product-spec mode)     | `prd.md`                      | Write user stories + Gherkin acceptance criteria without business-framing sections in the way |
| Maintainer (author, engineering mode)      | `tech-docs.md`, `delivery.md` | Record architecture and a granular checklist                                                  |
| Maintainer (reviewer at PR / cold re-read) | `README.md` → targeted file   | Navigate quickly to the concern relevant to the current review or resumption                  |
| `plan-maker` agent                         | All five                      | Scaffold the new five-doc layout on request                                                   |
| `plan-checker` agent                       | All five                      | Validate presence, content, and cross-references                                              |
| plan-execution workflow (calling context)  | `delivery.md`                 | Drive checklist execution; may read `brd.md` / `prd.md` / `tech-docs.md` for context          |
| `plan-execution-checker` agent             | `prd.md` + `delivery.md`      | Verify completed work satisfies acceptance criteria                                           |

## User Stories

### US-1: Plan author creates a new multi-file plan

**As a** plan author
**I want** the convention to specify BRD and PRD as distinct documents
**So that** I can write business rationale without tangling it with user stories

### US-2: Reviewer assesses business impact at code review

**As a** maintainer reviewing a plan PR (or cold-re-reading an existing plan)
**I want** a dedicated `brd.md` file
**So that** I can assess business impact and intent without scrolling past product specifications

### US-3: Author writes acceptance criteria without business-framing churn

**As a** maintainer authoring user stories and Gherkin acceptance criteria
**I want** a dedicated `prd.md` file
**So that** I can iterate on product scope without churning business-rationale sections

### US-4: Plan agent produces compliant scaffolding

**As a** user invoking `plan-maker`
**I want** the agent to scaffold the new five-doc layout
**So that** plans produced after this change are compliant by default

### US-5: Plan-checker validates the new layout

**As a** user running `plan-checker` on a new plan
**I want** the checker to flag missing `brd.md` or `prd.md`, and flag content-placement errors (business content in PRD, product content in BRD)
**So that** the split is enforced, not merely documented

### US-6: Plan-execution workflow locates the delivery checklist

**As a** user running the plan-execution workflow on a new-layout plan
**I want** the calling context to read `delivery.md` unchanged
**So that** execution mechanics are not disrupted by the document split

### US-7: Existing in-progress plan migrates cleanly

**As a** user of the `organiclever-fe-local-first` plan (currently in-progress)
**I want** its `requirements.md` split into `brd.md` + `prd.md` without losing content
**So that** the repository has zero plans on the deprecated layout and the migration proves the approach

## Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)

### AC-1: Convention document defines the five-doc layout

```gherkin
Feature: Plans Organization Convention specifies five-document layout

  Scenario: Multi-file layout section lists all five documents
    Given the file governance/conventions/structure/plans.md
    When I read the "Multi-File Structure" section
    Then it lists README.md, brd.md, prd.md, tech-docs.md, delivery.md as the five canonical files
    And it describes the purpose of each file
    And it clarifies that brd.md holds business impact, intent, success metrics, and affected roles (no human sign-off gate)
    And it clarifies that prd.md holds user stories, Gherkin acceptance criteria, and product scope

  Scenario: Single-file exception criteria are updated
    Given the file governance/conventions/structure/plans.md
    When I read the "Single-File Structure" section
    Then it references the five-doc layout as the default
    And it retains the ≤1000-line threshold for the single-file exception
    And it notes that a single-file plan's README.md must cover both business and product concerns explicitly
```

### AC-2: All four plan agents reflect the new layout

```gherkin
Feature: Plan agents reference the five-doc layout

  Scenario: plan-maker scaffolds five documents
    Given the file .claude/agents/plan-maker.md
    When I search for file-scaffolding instructions
    Then the agent is instructed to create README.md, brd.md, prd.md, tech-docs.md, delivery.md for multi-file plans
    And content-placement guidance is provided for brd.md and prd.md

  Scenario: plan-checker validates five-doc presence
    Given the file .claude/agents/plan-checker.md
    When I search for multi-file validation rules
    Then the checker is instructed to flag missing brd.md or prd.md
    And the checker validates that Gherkin acceptance criteria live in prd.md, not brd.md

  Scenario: plan-execution workflow reads delivery.md
    Given the file governance/workflows/plan/plan-execution.md
    When I search for delivery-checklist location
    Then the calling context is instructed to read delivery.md (unchanged from prior convention)
    And the calling context may consult brd.md, prd.md, tech-docs.md for context

  Scenario: plan-execution-checker validates against prd.md
    Given the file .claude/agents/plan-execution-checker.md
    When I search for acceptance-criteria validation
    Then the checker is instructed to read prd.md for Gherkin criteria
    And the checker validates delivered work against prd.md scenarios

  Scenario: plan-fixer applies corrections to the right file
    Given the file .claude/agents/plan-fixer.md
    When I search for content-placement rules
    Then the fixer is instructed to move business content into brd.md and product content into prd.md on misplacement findings
```

### AC-3: Plan workflows reflect the five-doc layout

```gherkin
Feature: Plan workflows reference the five-doc layout

  Scenario: plan-quality-gate workflow lists the five canonical documents
    Given the file governance/workflows/plan/plan-quality-gate.md
    When I read the "Plan-Specific Validation" section
    Then the completeness bullet enumerates README.md, brd.md, prd.md, tech-docs.md, delivery.md for multi-file plans
    And it clarifies the single-file exception still allows a single README.md when eligible

  Scenario: plan-execution workflow still drives from delivery.md
    Given the file governance/workflows/plan/plan-execution.md
    When I read the execution instructions
    Then the workflow reads delivery.md as the sequential checklist (unchanged)
    And it notes that the executor may consult brd.md, prd.md, tech-docs.md for context on ambiguous items
    And no stale reference to requirements.md remains
```

### AC-4: Skill and cross-references stay in sync

```gherkin
Feature: Skills and cross-referenced docs reflect the new layout

  Scenario: plan-creating-project-plans skill updated
    Given the file .claude/skills/plan-creating-project-plans/SKILL.md
    When I read the plan-structure section
    Then it reflects the five-doc layout
    And any example plan shown uses brd.md and prd.md

  Scenario: Cross-referenced docs are consistent
    Given the files governance/development/infra/acceptance-criteria.md, docs/how-to/organize-work.md, AGENTS.md
    When I search for references to requirements.md
    Then every reference has been updated to brd.md, prd.md, or removed as appropriate
    And no stale reference to the four-document layout remains
```

### AC-5: OpenCode mirrors are synced

```gherkin
Feature: .opencode/ mirrors match .claude/ sources

  Scenario: Sync script runs clean
    Given the .claude/ directory has been updated
    When I run `npm run sync:claude-to-opencode`
    Then the script completes successfully
    And git status shows all corresponding .opencode/ files updated

  Scenario: Mirrored agents and skills match
    Given the four plan agents in .opencode/agent/ and the plan skill in .opencode/skill/
    When I diff them against their .claude/ sources (ignoring format-level differences per sync rules)
    Then semantic content is equivalent
```

### AC-6: Existing active plan is migrated

```gherkin
Feature: organiclever-fe-local-first plan migrated to new layout

  Scenario: Directory structure after migration
    Given the folder plans/in-progress/2026-04-16__organiclever-fe-local-first/
    When I list files
    Then the folder contains README.md, brd.md, prd.md, tech-docs.md, delivery.md
    And it does not contain requirements.md

  Scenario: Content preserved across split
    Given the prior requirements.md of that plan
    When I inspect the new brd.md and prd.md
    Then business-impact content has moved into brd.md
    And user-story / acceptance-criteria content has moved into prd.md
    And no content from the prior file is lost

  Scenario: README cross-links updated
    Given the plan README.md
    When I read the "Plan Documents" section
    Then it links to brd.md and prd.md (not requirements.md)
```

### AC-7: Zero deprecated references remain

```gherkin
Feature: Repository is free of stale four-document layout references

  Scenario: No in-progress or backlog plan uses requirements.md
    Given the folders plans/in-progress/ and plans/backlog/
    When I search recursively for files named requirements.md
    Then zero results are returned
    And archived plans in plans/done/ are grandfathered (not searched)

  Scenario: No agent or skill mentions requirements.md as canonical
    Given the .claude/agents/ and .claude/skills/ directories
    When I grep for "requirements.md"
    Then every remaining reference is in a historical or migration context, not as the canonical file name
```

## Out of Scope (Product)

- **Migrating archived plans** in `plans/done/`.
- **Updating parent `ose-projects` plan convention** — separate repo, separate plan.
- **Renaming `tech-docs.md` or `delivery.md`** — not part of this change.
- **Template generator** for scaffolding new plans — `plan-maker` agent covers this.
- **GitHub Actions or CI enforcement** of the new layout beyond what `plan-checker` / pre-push already cover.

## Product-Level Risks

| Risk                                                                                      | Likelihood | Mitigation                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent round-trip failure — `plan-checker` or `plan-execution-checker` misreads new layout | Low        | Covered by AC-2 agent scenarios; validated against this plan itself       |
| Convention introduces sign-off ceremony framing unintentionally                           | Low        | BRD scope note and tech-docs Content-Placement Rules explicitly forbid it |
