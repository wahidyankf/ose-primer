# Requirements

## Objectives

### Primary Objectives

1. **PO-1: Structural Consistency** - All 6 languages must have identical directory structure, file naming patterns, and navigation weight system as defined in Programming Language Content Standard
2. **PO-2: Content Completeness** - All languages must have equivalent content coverage (tutorials, how-to guides, explanations, references) meeting or exceeding quality benchmarks
3. **PO-3: Quality Baseline** - All content must meet quality metrics from Programming Language Content Standard (line counts, diagram counts, cross-references, runnable code)
4. **PO-4: Navigation Correctness** - All languages must have cookbook at position 3 (weight 1000001), overview at position 1 (weight 1000000), and correct weight progression for all files

### Secondary Objectives

1. **SO-1: Documentation of Excellence** - Identify and document the "highest standard" examples from each language for future reference
2. **SO-2: Validation Patterns** - Create reusable validation scripts/checklists for future language additions
3. **SO-3: Language-Specific Preservation** - Preserve unique, high-quality language-specific content while ensuring baseline parity

## User Stories

### US-1: Learner Consistency

**As a** learner exploring multiple programming languages on ayokoding-fs
**I want** consistent structure, navigation, and content depth across all languages
**So that** I can efficiently compare languages and transfer learning patterns

**Acceptance Criteria:**

```gherkin
Feature: Consistent learner experience across programming languages

  Scenario: Navigating different language sections
    Given I am viewing the Golang tutorials section
    When I switch to Python tutorials section
    Then I see the same 5 tutorial levels (initial-setup, quick-start, beginner, intermediate, advanced)
    And I see the same navigation structure (tutorials, how-to, explanation, reference)
    And I see the cookbook at position 3 in how-to guides

  Scenario: Comparing content depth
    Given I complete the Beginner tutorial for Golang
    When I start the Beginner tutorial for Rust
    Then I encounter similar coverage depth (0-60% knowledge range)
    And I find similar pedagogical patterns (learning path diagrams, prerequisites, exercises)
    And I see comparable line counts (within 20% variance from benchmark)

  Scenario: Finding practical solutions
    Given I need a solution for error handling
    When I check the cookbook for any language
    Then I find 30+ recipes organized by category
    And I see consistent recipe structure (Problem, Solution, How It Works, Use Cases)
    And I can easily locate equivalent recipes across languages
```

### US-2: Content Creator Consistency

**As a** content creator adding new programming language content
**I want** clear reference examples showing the "highest standard" for each content type
**So that** I can create content that meets or exceeds existing quality benchmarks

**Acceptance Criteria:**

```gherkin
Feature: Clear quality benchmarks for content creation

  Scenario: Creating a new tutorial
    Given I am writing a Beginner tutorial for a new language
    When I reference the Programming Language Content Standard
    Then I see specific examples of "highest standard" Beginner tutorials
    And I see quantitative metrics (line counts, diagram counts, exercise counts)
    And I see qualitative requirements (pedagogical patterns, code quality, accessibility)

  Scenario: Validating content quality
    Given I have completed a cookbook for a new language
    When I run ayokoding-fs-general-checker
    Then I receive specific feedback on structural compliance
    When I run ayokoding-fs-facts-checker
    Then I receive specific feedback on factual correctness
    And I can compare my metrics against documented benchmarks
```

### US-3: Quality Assurance Efficiency

**As a** QA reviewer validating programming language content
**I want** automated validation for structural and quality requirements
**So that** I can focus on pedagogical effectiveness rather than manual checklist verification

**Acceptance Criteria:**

```gherkin
Feature: Automated quality validation

  Scenario: Structural validation
    Given a programming language content folder exists
    When I run ayokoding-fs-structure-checker
    Then I see validation of all required files (tutorials, how-to, explanation, reference)
    And I see validation of weight ordering (cookbook at 1000001)
    And I see validation of file naming patterns
    And I receive zero violations for compliant content

  Scenario: Content quality validation
    Given a programming language has all required content files
    When I run ayokoding-fs-general-checker
    Then I see validation of color palette usage (accessible colors only)
    And I see validation of pedagogical patterns (front hooks, learning paths)
    And I see validation of quality metrics (minimum line counts, cross-references)
    And I receive zero violations for compliant content

  Scenario: Factual accuracy validation
    Given a programming language tutorial contains code examples
    When I run ayokoding-fs-facts-checker
    Then I see validation of command syntax correctness
    And I see validation of version accuracy
    And I see validation of code example correctness
    And I receive confidence classifications for all factual claims
```

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints

- **C-T1**: Must work within existing ayokoding-fs Hugo + Hextra theme structure
- **C-T2**: Must preserve all existing content (no deletions except duplicates/errors)
- **C-T3**: Must maintain backward compatibility with existing navigation links

### Resource Constraints

- **C-R1**: Implementation uses existing AI agents (ayokoding-fs-general-maker, ayokoding-fs-general-checker, etc.)
- **C-R2**: Single PR delivery (all changes reviewed together for consistency)

### Policy Constraints

- **C-P1**: Must follow Trunk Based Development (work on main branch)
- **C-P2**: Must follow Programming Language Content Standard exactly
- **C-P3**: Must not introduce time estimates in any content

## Assumptions

1. **A-1**: The Programming Language Content Standard accurately reflects desired state
2. **A-2**: Existing Elixir content represents reference implementation for cookbook positioning. Golang, Python, and Java represent reference implementations for content completeness.
3. **A-3**: Existing AI agents (checkers, makers) work correctly
4. **A-4**: Content creators will use documented highest standards for future additions
5. **A-5**: Minor language-specific variations (topic choices, specific examples) are acceptable as long as baseline structure and quality are met

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly OUT OF SCOPE for this plan:

1. **Content Translation**: Creating or updating Indonesian (Bahasa) versions of content (focus on English structural parity first)
2. **New Content Creation**: Adding entirely new tutorials, guides, or topics not present in any language
3. **Major Rewrites**: Comprehensive rewriting of existing content that already meets quality standards
4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimizing Hugo build times or page load speeds
5. **Design Changes**: Modifying Hextra theme, navigation UI, or visual design
6. **External Resources**: Creating or updating external documentation, videos, or supplementary materials
7. **API Documentation**: Creating programmatic API reference documentation (reference/ folder is placeholder only)
8. **Deprecated Features**: Documenting deprecated language features (focus on current/stable features only)
