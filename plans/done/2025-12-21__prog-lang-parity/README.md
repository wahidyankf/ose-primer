# Programming Language Content Parity Plan

**Status:** Done

**Git Workflow:** Trunk Based Development (main branch)

**Delivery Type:** Direct commits to main branch (no PRs)

## Overview

Bring all 6 programming languages (Python, Golang, Java, Kotlin, Rust, Elixir) to complete parity based on the highest standards identified across all languages. This ensures consistent learner experience, complete coverage, and uniform quality across all programming language content on ayokoding-fs.

- [Technical Documentation](./tech-docs.md) - Analysis methodology and parity standards
- [Delivery Plan](./delivery.md) - Implementation phases and validation

## Goals

**Primary Goals:**

1. **Structural Parity**: All 6 languages follow identical directory structure, file naming, and navigation weight system
2. **Content Completeness**: All languages have equivalent coverage across tutorials, how-to guides, explanations, and references
3. **Quality Parity**: All content meets or exceeds quality benchmarks from Programming Language Content Standard
4. **Navigation Consistency**: Weight ordering correct, cookbook at position 3, all required files present

**Secondary Goals:**

1. Document the "highest standard" found for each content type to serve as future reference
2. Create reusable validation patterns for future language additions
3. Identify and preserve language-specific excellence while ensuring baseline parity

## Context

The ayokoding-fs site has 6 programming languages under `/en/learn/swe/programming-languages/`:

- Python (reference implementation for dynamic languages)
- Golang (reference implementation for concurrent programming)
- Java (reference implementation for OOP/enterprise)
- Kotlin (JVM modern alternative)
- Rust (systems programming, memory safety)
- Elixir (functional programming, OTP platform)

Recent analysis identified inconsistencies:

1. **Python**: Has duplicate type hints file (`type-hints-effectively.md` vs `use-type-hints-effectively.md`) - NEEDS RESOLUTION
2. **5 languages (Python, Golang, Java, Kotlin, Rust)**: Have cookbook at weight 1000030 (should be 1000001). Only Elixir is currently compliant and serves as reference implementation for cookbook positioning.
3. **File counts**: Minor variance in how-to guide counts (Elixir: 27, others: 26 or fewer)
4. **Unknown variances**: Potential differences in tutorial lengths, cookbook completeness, quality metrics

This plan establishes the highest standard from each language and brings all others to that level.

## Success Criteria

1. All 6 languages pass `ayokoding-fs-general-checker` with zero violations
2. All 6 languages pass `ayokoding-fs-structure-checker` with zero violations
3. All 6 languages pass `ayokoding-fs-facts-checker` with zero factual errors
4. All 6 languages have identical file counts for structural files (tutorials, explanation, reference overview files)
5. Cookbook positioned at weight 1000001 in all languages
6. All languages meet or exceed quality benchmarks from Programming Language Content Standard
7. Documentation updated with "highest standard" reference examples
