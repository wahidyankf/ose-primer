# Delivery Plan

## Overview

### Delivery Type

**Direct commits to main branch** - All parity work committed directly to main branch with progressive commits by language and change type.

### Git Workflow

**Trunk Based Development** - Work on `main` branch with atomic commits for each language and change type.

### Summary

Bring all 6 programming languages (Python, Golang, Java, Kotlin, Rust, Elixir) to complete parity through a 4-phase process: Analysis → Standards Definition → Remediation → Validation. Expected output: Zero violations from all automated checkers, all languages meeting or exceeding Programming Language Content Standard benchmarks.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Analysis

**Status:** ✅ Implementation Complete - Awaiting Validation

**Goal:** Establish complete baseline of current state and identify all gaps across all 6 languages.

#### Implementation Steps

- [x] **Step 1.1**: Create language inventory script
  - Write bash script to count files by category for each language
  - Count lines for each file using `wc -l`
  - Extract weights from frontmatter using `grep`
  - Output to CSV for spreadsheet import
  - Expected output: analysis-inventory.csv
  - **Implementation Notes**: Created comprehensive bash script `inventory-script.sh` with file counting, line counting, weight extraction, quality metrics (diagrams, code blocks, links, color violations), and pedagogical pattern detection (front hooks, learning paths, prerequisites). Script generates both analysis-inventory.csv and analysis-quality-metrics.csv.
  - **Date**: 2025-12-21
  - **Status**: Completed
  - **Files Changed**:
    - plans/in-progress/2025-12-21\_\_prog-lang-parity/inventory-script.sh (new)

- [x] **Step 1.2**: Run inventory across all languages
  - Execute inventory script for: Python, Golang, Java, Kotlin, Rust, Elixir
  - Import results into spreadsheet
  - Create side-by-side comparison matrix
  - Identify missing files (compare against Programming Language Content Standard structure)
  - Expected output: `analysis-inventory.csv`
  - **Implementation Notes**: Executed inventory script successfully. Generated analysis-inventory.csv (121 rows) and analysis-quality-metrics.csv (132 rows) covering all 6 languages with comprehensive metrics: file counts, line counts, weights, diagram counts, code block counts, link counts, color violations, and pedagogical pattern presence indicators.
  - **Date**: 2025-12-21
  - **Status**: Completed
  - **Files Changed**:
    - plans/in-progress/2025-12-21\_\_prog-lang-parity/analysis-inventory.csv (new)
    - plans/in-progress/2025-12-21\_\_prog-lang-parity/analysis-quality-metrics.csv (new)

- [x] **Step 1.3**: Measure quality metrics
  - Count Mermaid diagrams: `grep -c "^```mermaid" *.md` for each file
  - Count cross-references: `grep -c "](/" *.md` for each file
  - Count code examples: `grep -c "^```" *.md` for each file
  - Check color palette: `grep -i "#ff0000\|#00ff00\|#ffff00\|red\|green\|yellow" *.md` for violations
  - Check pedagogical patterns: `grep` for "Want to", learning path diagrams, prerequisites sections
  - Expected output: `analysis-quality-metrics.csv`
  - **Implementation Notes**: Completed via inventory script (Step 1.2). Quality metrics CSV includes: DiagramCount (0-6 per file), CodeBlockCount (0-262 per file), LinkCount (0-52 per file), ColorViolations (0-5 per file), HasFrontHook (all false), HasLearningPath (varies by language), HasPrerequisites (varies by language). Key findings: 0% front hook compliance across all languages, Rust has 9 color violations (highest), Elixir has 8 violations.
  - **Date**: 2025-12-21
  - **Status**: Completed

- [x] **Step 1.4**: Identify structural issues
  - Compare file lists against Programming Language Content Standard required files
  - Check weights for cookbook (should be 1000001)
  - Check weights for tutorials (should be 1000001-1000005 sequential)
  - Check category folder weights (tutorials=100002, how-to=100003, explanation=100004, reference=100005)
  - Expected output: `structural-gaps.md`
  - **Implementation Notes**: Created comprehensive structural gaps analysis. Critical finding: 5 out of 6 languages (Python, Golang, Java, Kotlin, Rust) have cookbook at weight 1000030 instead of required 1000001. Only Elixir is fully compliant. All 5 languages also have incorrect category folder weights and tutorial weights starting at 1000002 instead of 1000001. Documented complete remediation strategy with weight correction formulas. Estimated 90 files require weight updates.
  - **Date**: 2025-12-21
  - **Status**: Completed
  - **Files Changed**:
    - plans/in-progress/2025-12-21\_\_prog-lang-parity/structural-gaps.md (new)

- [x] **Step 1.5**: Identify content gaps
  - Count how-to guides (minimum 12 required)
  - Count cookbook recipes (minimum 30 required)
  - Identify files below minimum line counts
  - List missing required files
  - Expected output: `content-gaps.md`
  - **Implementation Notes**: Created content gaps analysis. Critical findings: Python quick-start (440 lines, needs 600), Golang initial-setup (274 lines, needs 300), Golang quick-start (394 lines, needs 600) below minimums. Java and Kotlin best-practices barely passing (549 and 509 lines, target 600). Identified Elixir as highest standard (tutorial total: 8087 lines, 97% above minimum). Rust has excellent content with no gaps. Prioritized remediation: 6 files need expansion totaling 626 additional lines.
  - **Date**: 2025-12-21
  - **Status**: Completed
  - **Files Changed**:
    - plans/in-progress/2025-12-21\_\_prog-lang-parity/content-gaps.md (new)

- [x] **Step 1.6**: Identify quality gaps
  - List files missing pedagogical patterns
  - List color palette violations
  - List files with time estimates
  - List broken cross-references
  - Expected output: `quality-gaps.md`
  - **Implementation Notes**: Created quality gaps analysis. Severe findings: 0% front hook compliance across ALL 30 tutorials (6 languages × 5 tutorials). Python and Golang have 0% learning path and prerequisites compliance. All languages have minimal cross-references (0-7 links per tutorial, target 10+). Color violations: Rust (9), Elixir (8), Kotlin (2). Elixir closest to quality parity with only front hooks and cross-references missing. Documented comprehensive remediation priorities: 30 front hooks to add, 10 learning paths, 10 prerequisites sections, 225 cross-references, 19 color fixes.
  - **Date**: 2025-12-21
  - **Status**: Completed
  - **Files Changed**:
    - plans/in-progress/2025-12-21\_\_prog-lang-parity/quality-gaps.md (new)

- [x] **Step 1.7**: Identify highest standards
  - For each content type, identify the best example across all 6 languages
  - Document what makes it "highest standard"
  - Create reference table mapping content type → example file
  - Expected output: `highest-standards.md`
  - **Implementation Notes**: Created highest standards reference document with detailed analysis of all content types. Elixir dominates with 8 out of 11 categories (73% of highest standards): all 5 tutorials, cookbook, best practices, and anti-patterns. Alternative excellence: Golang (cheat sheet 1404 lines, beginner diagrams 6), Java (glossary 1873 lines, resources 879 lines). Key insight: Elixir is most recently added language (Dec 2024) and most closely follows Programming Language Content Standard. Documented gaps even in highest standards: no front hooks anywhere, low cross-reference counts need improvement even in Elixir.
  - **Date**: 2025-12-21
  - **Status**: Completed
  - **Files Changed**:
    - plans/in-progress/2025-12-21\_\_prog-lang-parity/highest-standards.md (new)

- [x] **Step 1.8**: Create comprehensive analysis report
  - Consolidate all gap lists
  - Prioritize gaps by severity (high/medium/low)
  - Estimate remediation effort per language
  - Expected output: `analysis-report.md`
  - **Implementation Notes**: Created comprehensive analysis report consolidating all findings. Executive summary: Elixir ONLY fully compliant language, 5 languages require structural fixes, 3 have content gaps, all 6 have severe quality gaps. Gap prioritization: Priority 1 CRITICAL (cookbook weights in 5 languages, content below minimum in 3 files, color violations in 2 languages), Priority 2 HIGH (category/tutorial weights, front hooks for all, learning paths/prerequisites for Python/Golang), Priority 3 MEDIUM (cross-references, remaining learning paths). Effort estimation: 52-66 hours total (Python/Golang highest at 12-15h each, Elixir lowest at 4-6h). Risk assessment included with mitigation strategies.

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

- **Phase 2 depends on Phase 1**: Standards defined based on analysis results
- **Phase 3 depends on Phase 2**: Remediation follows defined standards
- **Phase 4 depends on Phase 3**: Validation verifies remediation complete

### External Dependencies

- **Programming Language Content Standard**: Must be current and accurate
- **Hugo Content Convention - ayokoding**: Weight system must be documented
- **Color Accessibility Convention**: Approved palette must be documented
- **All checker agents**: Must be functioning correctly
  - ayokoding-fs-structure-checker
  - ayokoding-fs-general-checker
  - ayokoding-fs-facts-checker
  - ayokoding-fs-link-checker

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Large changeset difficult to track

**Severity:** Medium

**Mitigation:**

- Use atomic commits per language and change type
- Provide comprehensive commit messages with before/after metrics
- Include validation reports in commit descriptions
- Commit incrementally with clear progress markers
- Document changes by language in final commit summary

### Risk 2: Remediation introduces new errors

**Severity:** Medium

**Mitigation:**

- Run validators after each language remediation
- Progressive commits allow easy rollback of specific changes
- Manual QA catches non-automated issues
- Code examples tested in actual environments
- Factual accuracy verified with WebSearch/WebFetch

### Risk 3: Scope creep during remediation

**Severity:** Low

**Mitigation:**

- Follow parity standards strictly (no "nice to have" additions)
- Focus on meeting minimums, not exceeding maximally
- Document "future improvements" separately (not in this plan)
- Time-box remediation per language

### Risk 4: Checkers may have bugs

**Severity:** Low

**Mitigation:**

- Manual QA validates checker results
- Cross-check multiple validators (structure + content + facts)
- Report checker bugs separately if found
- Use manual verification as fallback

### Risk 5: Breaking changes to live content

**Severity:** High

**Mitigation:**

- Preserve all existing content (only add/fix, no deletion except duplicates)
- Test all cross-references still work
- Hugo build must succeed
- Verify navigation doesn't break
- Rollback plan ready if issues found post-merge
