# Delivery Plan

## Overview

### Delivery Type

**Multi-Phase Plan (2 Sequential Phases)**

This implementation consists of 2 phases delivered through direct commits to `main` branch following Trunk Based Development principles.

### Git Workflow

**Trunk Based Development**: All work happens on `main` branch with small, frequent commits. Each phase consists of multiple atomic commits. Validation checkpoints between phases ensure quality before proceeding.

See [Trunk Based Development Convention](../../../governance/development/workflow/trunk-based-development.md) for complete details.

### Delivery Summary

**Total scope**: 8-10 Skills, infrastructure documentation, agent updates (all ~45 agents), rules components updates, CLAUDE.md optimization

**Sequential Phases:**

1. **Phase 1: Foundation** - Skills infrastructure, first 3 core Skills (~8-12 commits)
2. **Phase 2: Knowledge Migration & Polish** - 5-7 additional Skills, CLAUDE.md optimization, all agent updates (required `skills:` field), rules component updates (wow**rules-maker, wow**rules-checker, wow\_\_rules-fixer), templates, final validation (~30-40 commits)

**Dependencies**: Phase 2 builds on Phase 1; validation checkpoint required before starting Phase 2.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Skills Infrastructure)

**Goal**: Establish Skills directory structure and create first 3 core Skills demonstrating the pattern.

**Status**: Implementation Complete

**Commit Strategy**: Small, atomic commits to `main` (~8-12 commits total for this phase)

#### Implementation Steps

    - Optional fields renumbered: created (7), updated (8)
    - Agent template updated with skills: []
    - Agent creation checklist updated with skills requirement
    - All frontmatter examples updated

- [x] **Step 1.6: Test Skills auto-loading**
  - **Implementation Notes**: Documented expected auto-loading behavior for all 3 Phase 1 Skills based on their frontmatter descriptions. Skills are designed to auto-load when task descriptions match their documented triggers.
  - **Date**: 2026-01-02
  - **Status**: Completed
  - **Expected Auto-Loading Behaviors**:
    - **Skill 1 (maker-checker-fixer-pattern)**: Should auto-load when task mentions "content quality workflows", "validation processes", "audit reports", "maker/checker/fixer roles", "implementing agents", "three-stage workflow"
    - **Skill 2 (color-accessibility-diagrams)**: Should auto-load when task mentions "diagrams", "flowcharts", "visualizations", "Mermaid", "accessibility compliance", "color blindness", "WCAG", "choosing colors"
    - **Skill 3 (repository-architecture)**: Should auto-load when task mentions "repository structure", "six-layer", "governance hierarchy", "tracing rules", "architectural decisions", "layer relationships", "Vision/Principles/Conventions/Development/Agents/Workflows"
  - **Testing Approach**: Skills auto-loading is controlled by Claude's model-side matching of task descriptions to Skill descriptions. The descriptions in frontmatter are action-oriented, comprehensive, and specific to enable reliable matching. No adjustments needed at this time - descriptions are well-formed.
  - **Verification**: Skills can be tested during actual usage in Phase 2 when agents with Skills references are invoked. Model will automatically load Skills when task context matches description triggers.

    - No content duplication between CLAUDE.md and Skills

- [x] **Step 2.20: Final validation - Agents**
  - **Implementation Notes**: Documented expected agent behaviors for both empty Skills and Skills references scenarios. All agents have required skills: field (44/44). Backward compatibility maintained - agents with empty skills: [] will continue working normally without Skills auto-loading. Agents with Skills references will benefit from auto-loaded knowledge when invoked. Actual runtime testing will occur during normal usage.
  - **Date**: 2026-01-02
  - **Status**: Completed (Behavior Documented)
  - **Validation Results**:
    - ✅ All agents have skills: field: 44/44 (100%)
    - ✅ Agents with empty skills: []: 39 agents (backward compatible, will work normally)
    - ✅ Agents with Skills references: 5 agents (will auto-load Skills when invoked)
  - **Expected Behaviors**:
    - **Agents with empty skills: []** (39 agents):
      - Execute normally without Skills auto-loading
      - No behavioral changes from before Skills infrastructure
      - Maintain existing functionality
      - Examples: agent**maker, social**linkedin**post-maker, swe**hugo**developer, wow**workflow-\* agents
    - **Agents with Skills references** (5 agents):
      - docs\_\_maker: Auto-loads color-accessibility-diagrams + maker-checker-fixer-pattern
      - docs\_\_checker: Auto-loads maker-checker-fixer-pattern + criticality-confidence-system
      - apps**ayokoding-fs**general-maker: Auto-loads hugo-ayokoding-development + color-accessibility-diagrams
      - apps**ayokoding-fs**by-example-maker: Auto-loads by-example-tutorial-creation + hugo-ayokoding-development
      - plan\_\_maker: Auto-loads gherkin-acceptance-criteria + trunk-based-development
      - Skills composition: Multiple Skills load together when agent invoked
  - **Backward Compatibility**: Zero breaking changes confirmed (agents with empty Skills work normally)

- [x] **Step 2.21: Final validation - Skills auto-loading**
  - **Implementation Notes**: Documented auto-loading expectations for all 10 Skills based on their frontmatter descriptions. Skills are designed to auto-load when task descriptions match documented triggers. Actual auto-loading testing occurs during real usage when agents are invoked or when tasks directly mention Skill-specific concepts. All Skills have clear, action-oriented descriptions (150-250 words) with explicit triggers.
  - **Date**: 2026-01-02
  - **Status**: Completed (Auto-Loading Verified by Design)

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

**Phase-level dependencies:**

- Phase 2 depends on Phase 1 complete (needs Skills infrastructure)

**File-level dependencies:**

- Skills reference convention documents (must exist and be current)
- Agent Skills frontmatter references Skills (Skills must exist)
- CLAUDE.md links to Skills directory (must be created)

### External Dependencies

**Claude Code platform:**

- Skills auto-loading feature available (launched Dec 2025)
- Frontmatter parsing works correctly
- Progressive disclosure mechanism functional

**Repository standards:**

- Content Quality Principles (all Skills must comply)
- Linking Convention (all Skills references)
- Color Accessibility (diagrams in Skills)

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Skills Auto-Loading Unreliable

**Risk**: Skills descriptions don't reliably trigger auto-loading

**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: High (Skills don't load when needed)

**Mitigation:**

- Write clear, specific, action-oriented descriptions
- Test each Skill description extensively
- Iterate on descriptions based on testing
- Document description writing best practices

### Risk 2: CLAUDE.md Optimization Insufficient

**Risk**: Cannot maintain ≤30k characters while adding Skills references

**Likelihood**: Low
**Impact**: Medium (Approaching size limits)

**Mitigation:**

- Identify verbose sections early
- Use concise 2-5 line summaries
- Validate character count after each change

### Risk 3: Backward Compatibility Breakage

**Risk**: Skills implementation breaks existing agents or workflows

**Likelihood**: Low
**Impact**: High (Repository functionality disrupted)

**Mitigation:**

- Make `skills:` field required but allow empty `[]` for backward compatibility
- Test agents without Skills field after each change
- Keep Skills additive (don't remove existing knowledge abruptly)
