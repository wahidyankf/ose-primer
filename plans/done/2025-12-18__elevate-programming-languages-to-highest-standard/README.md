# Elevate Programming Languages to Highest Standard

**Status**: Done
**Completed**: 2026-01-10

**Created**: 2025-12-18

**Delivery Type**: Multi-PR Plan (4 PRs, one per language)

**Git Workflow**: Trunk Based Development (work on `main` branch)

## Overview

This plan outlines the comprehensive enhancement of all 4 programming language content on ayokoding-fs (Python, Java, Kotlin, Golang) to meet the highest standards defined in the [Programming Language Content Standard](../../../governance/conventions/tutorials/programming-language-content.md). The project brings all languages to production-ready quality with complete tutorials, cookbooks, reference documentation, and validation.

### Goals

1. **Achieve Uniform Excellence**: Bring all 4 languages to production-ready status with consistent quality
2. **Address Critical Gaps**: Fix Python's tutorial deficiencies (Priority 1) and expand Kotlin's cookbook (Priority 2)
3. **Complete Reference Sections**: Add missing cheat sheets, glossaries, and resources across all languages
4. **Expand Practical Content**: Grow cookbooks and how-to guides to benchmark targets (30+ recipes, 12-18 guides)
5. **Enhance Philosophy Content**: Improve overview.md, best-practices, and anti-patterns for depth and engagement
6. **Validate Comprehensively**: Pass all checker agents (content, facts, links) before deployment

### Context

Based on detailed comparative analysis, the 4 languages currently rank:

1. **Kotlin**: 92/100 - Most comprehensive tutorials, strong reference, needs cookbook expansion
2. **Java**: 85/100 - Best cookbook (gold standard), needs reference section and more how-to guides
3. **Golang**: 82/100 - Strong foundation, needs reference section and additional how-to guides
4. **Python**: 70/100 - Best overview but critical tutorial gaps (smallest tutorials, urgent priority)

**Total Work Required**: ~502KB of new content across all languages to reach highest standard.

### Success Criteria

All 4 languages achieve:

- ✅ All 5 tutorial levels meeting line count benchmarks (initial-setup through advanced)
- ✅ Complete reference section (cheat-sheet, glossary, resources)
- ✅ 30+ recipe cookbooks (4,000-5,500 lines)
- ✅ 12-18 how-to guides appropriate to language complexity
- ✅ Enhanced philosophy sections (overview, best-practices, anti-patterns)
- ✅ Pass ayokoding-fs-general-checker validation
- ✅ Pass ayokoding-fs-facts-checker verification
- ✅ Pass ayokoding-fs-link-checker validation

## Plan Structure

This plan is organized into multiple documents:

- **[requirements.md](./requirements.md)** - Objectives, user stories, functional requirements, constraints
- **[tech-docs.md](./tech-docs.md)** - Architecture, language priorities, implementation approach
- **[delivery.md](./delivery.md)** - Implementation phases, validation strategy, dependencies
