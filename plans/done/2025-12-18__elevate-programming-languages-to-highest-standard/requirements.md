## User Stories

### Story 1: Python Learner Needs Complete Tutorial Path

**As a** developer learning Python for the first time
**I want** comprehensive tutorials from setup through advanced topics
**So that** I can build a solid foundation without gaps

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Scenario: Complete Python learning path
  Given I visit the Python tutorials section
  When I navigate through initial-setup, quick-start, beginner, intermediate, and advanced tutorials
  Then each tutorial meets the minimum line count benchmark
  And the content covers the stated coverage percentage (0-5%, 5-30%, 0-60%, 60-85%, 85-95%)
  And all code examples are runnable and correct
  And each tutorial has proper learning path diagrams
```

### Story 2: Kotlin Developer Needs Practical Recipes

**As a** Kotlin developer solving daily programming problems
**I want** a comprehensive cookbook with 30+ recipes
**So that** I can quickly find copy-paste solutions

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Scenario: Comprehensive Kotlin cookbook
  Given I open the Kotlin cookbook
  When I search for common patterns (data structures, concurrency, design patterns, etc.)
  Then I find 30+ recipes organized in 6-8 categories
  And each recipe follows the Problem → Solution → How It Works → Use Cases format
  And the cookbook is 4,000-5,500 lines (matching Java's gold standard)
  And all code examples work as-is
```

### Story 3: Java Developer Needs Quick Reference

**As a** Java developer needing quick syntax lookup
**I want** cheat sheet, glossary, and resources documentation
**So that** I can quickly find syntax and terminology

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Scenario: Complete Java reference section
  Given I visit the Java reference section
  When I look for quick syntax reference
  Then I find a cheat-sheet.md with common patterns (12KB target)
  And a glossary.md with terminology definitions (20KB target)
  And a resources.md with curated learning materials (12KB target)
  And all information is factually accurate
```

### Story 4: Golang Developer Needs More Problem-Solving Guides

**As a** Golang developer building production applications
**I want** 18 how-to guides covering language-specific patterns
**So that** I can solve common problems efficiently

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Scenario: Expanded Golang how-to section
  Given I visit the Golang how-to section
  When I count the available guides
  Then I find 18 guides (expanded from 14)
  And each guide is 200-500 lines
  And guides cover concurrency, error handling, web development, testing, etc.
  And all solutions are idiomatic Golang
```

### Story 5: Cross-Language Learner Expects Consistency

**As a** polyglot developer learning multiple languages
**I want** consistent structure across all language content
**So that** I can navigate efficiently without relearning the layout

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Scenario: Consistent structure across languages
  Given I visit Python, Java, Kotlin, and Golang sections
  When I check the directory structure and file organization
  Then all 4 languages have identical folder hierarchies
  And all use the same 5 tutorial levels
  And all have cookbooks at position 3 in how-to/ (weight: 603)
  And all follow category-based weight allocation (500s, 600s, 700s, 800s)
  And all use the same pedagogical patterns
```
