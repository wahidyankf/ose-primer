# Delivery Plan

## Overview

### Delivery Type

**Multi-PR Plan** - 4 Pull Requests (one per language)

Each PR delivers complete enhancement for a single programming language, allowing:

- Independent review and validation
- Isolated risk (issues affect one language only)
- Incremental value delivery
- Easier rollback if needed

### Git Workflow

**Trunk Based Development** - All work happens on `main` branch

- No feature branches (work directly on main)
- Small, frequent commits
- Push regularly (daily if possible)
- Use feature flags if needed to hide incomplete work

### Summary

This plan elevates 4 programming languages (Python, Java, Kotlin, Golang) to the highest standard defined in the Programming Language Content Standard. Total work: ~502KB of new content across tutorials, cookbooks, reference documentation, how-to guides, and philosophy sections.

**Priorities**:

1. **Python** (PRIORITY 1): 185KB expansion - addresses critical tutorial gaps, creates reference section, adds 3 how-to guides
2. **Kotlin** (PRIORITY 2): 70KB expansion - completes cookbook and philosophy (reference section already complete)
3. **Java** (PRIORITY 3): 128KB expansion - creates reference section, adds 7 how-to guides, expands tutorials
4. **Golang** (PRIORITY 4): 119KB expansion - creates reference section, adds 5 how-to guides, expands best-practices

## Implementation Phases

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

**Sequential Language Dependencies**:

    B -->|Merged| C[Java PR3]
    C -->|Merged| D[Golang PR4]

    style A fill:#CC78BC,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,color:#FFFFFF
    style B fill:#DE8F05,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000

    style D fill:#0173B2,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,color:#FFFFFF
```

**Color Palette**: Purple (#CC78BC), Orange (#DE8F05), Teal (#029E73), Blue (#0173B2) - color-blind friendly per Color Accessibility Convention

- **Python → Kotlin**: Python PR must merge before starting Kotlin (establishes patterns)
- **Kotlin → Java**: Kotlin PR must merge before starting Java (cookbook quality baseline)
- **Java → Golang**: Java PR must merge before starting Golang (reference section pattern)

**Rationale**: Sequential delivery prevents merge conflicts and enables pattern refinement

**Phase Dependencies Within Each Language**:

- Analysis → Content Creation (must understand current state)
- Content Creation → Validation (must create content before validating)
- Validation → Integration (must pass validation before PR)

### External Dependencies

**Tools and Services**:

- **Hugo 0.119.0+**: Static site generator (required for build)
- **Node.js + npm**: Development environment via Volta (required for Prettier)
- **Git**: Version control (required for commits and PRs)
- **ayokoding-fs-general-checker**: Validation agent (required for structural checks)
- **ayokoding-fs-facts-checker**: Validation agent (required for factual verification)
- **ayokoding-fs-link-checker**: Validation agent (required for link validation)

**Official Documentation**:

- **Python**: python.org, PEPs (authoritative source for facts)
- **Java**: docs.oracle.com, OpenJDK, JEPs (authoritative source)
- **Kotlin**: kotlinlang.org (authoritative source)
- **Golang**: go.dev, golang.org (authoritative source)

**Development Platforms**:

- **macOS 14+**: Testing platform for code examples
- **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**: Testing platform for code examples
- **Windows 11**: Testing platform for code examples

### Blocking Issues

**Known Blockers** (none currently):

- None identified

**Potential Blockers**:

1. **Language Version Changes**: If major language versions release during implementation, may need content updates
   - **Mitigation**: Target current stable versions, note version-specific content
2. **Documentation Unavailability**: If official docs temporarily unavailable
   - **Mitigation**: Use cached documentation, multiple authoritative sources
3. **Validation Agent Issues**: If checker agents have bugs
   - **Mitigation**: Manual validation fallback, report agent issues separately

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Content Quality Inconsistency Across Languages

**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: High
**Severity**: HIGH

**Description**: Different languages may end up with inconsistent quality levels despite meeting line count targets.

**Mitigation**:

- Use Java's cookbook as gold standard reference throughout
- Establish quality checklist before starting any content
- Review first language (Python) thoroughly to set pattern
- Apply learnings from each language to next ones

**Contingency**: If inconsistency detected, pause and revise quality standards before continuing

### Risk 2: Factual Errors in Code Examples

**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: Critical
**Severity**: CRITICAL

**Description**: Code examples may contain syntax errors, outdated patterns, or incorrect information.

**Mitigation**:

- Test ALL code examples on multiple platforms
- Use ayokoding-fs-facts-checker for verification
- Reference official documentation for every fact
- Run examples in clean environments (fresh venvs, new projects)

**Contingency**: If factual errors found in PR review, block merge until verified and fixed

### Risk 3: PR Review Bottleneck

**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium
**Severity**: MEDIUM

**Description**: Large PRs may take time to review, delaying subsequent language work.

**Mitigation**:

- Keep PRs focused (one language each)
- Provide detailed PR descriptions with validation evidence
- Proactively address review feedback
- Start next language analysis phase during PR review (non-blocking work)

**Contingency**: If review takes >1 week, schedule dedicated review session

### Risk 4: Language Version Changes Mid-Implementation

**Probability**: Low
**Impact**: Medium
**Severity**: MEDIUM

**Description**: New major language versions released during implementation requiring content updates.

**Mitigation**:

- Clearly mark version-specific content in all files
- Monitor language release schedules
- Design content to be version-resilient where possible
- Focus on stable LTS versions (Java 17, Python 3.11+)

**Contingency**: If major version releases, assess impact and update as separate mini-PR

### Risk 5: Validation Agent False Positives

**Probability**: Low
**Impact**: Low
**Severity**: LOW

**Description**: Checker agents may flag valid content as problematic.

**Mitigation**:

- Understand agent rules before starting content
- Manual review alongside automated checks
- Report agent issues if found
- Use manual validation fallback

**Contingency**: If agent has bugs, proceed with manual validation and report issues

### Risk 6: Scope Creep

**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium
**Severity**: MEDIUM

**Description**: Temptation to add more content beyond plan (e.g., framework tutorials, advanced topics).

**Mitigation**:

- Strictly follow line count targets (are minimums, not stretch goals)
- Reference "Out of Scope" section when tempted to add more
- Focus on quality over quantity
- Defer additional ideas to separate plans

**Contingency**: If scope creep detected, remove additional content and create separate plan
