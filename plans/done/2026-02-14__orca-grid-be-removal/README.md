# Remove orca-grid-be Application from Monorepo

**Status**: Completed
**Completion Date**: 2026-02-14

## Context

Remove the orca-grid-be Spring Boot application from the Nx monorepo as it is no longer needed. The application was initially created as "dolphin-be" for a Learning Management System, then renamed to "orca-grid-be" for a Knowledge Management System, but was never developed beyond initial Spring Boot setup.

**Current state:**

- Standalone Spring Boot app (Java 25, Maven, Spring Boot 4.0.2)
- Minimal implementation (just health check endpoints)
- NO code dependencies from other apps/libs
- NO CI/CD workflows
- Related apps (orca-grid-fe, orca-grid-be-e2e, orca-grid-fe-e2e) were planned but never created
- Extensive documentation in system-architecture.md (~90 references)
- Historical context in plans/done/2026-01-17\_\_dolphin-be-init/

**Target state:**

- Application directory removed
- All documentation references cleaned up
- Plan history preserved with removal notes
- Monorepo focused on 4 active applications only

**Rationale:**

- Keep monorepo focused on active projects (ose-platform-web, ayokoding-fs, ayokoding-cli, rhino-cli)
- Remove technical debt from planned-but-never-implemented Orca Grid suite
- Simplify system architecture to reflect actual implementation
- Preserve historical context for future decisions

## Approach

Comprehensive removal with documentation cleanup:

1. Remove application directory
2. Clean up all documentation references (system-architecture.md)
3. Update plan history with removal notes
4. Verify Nx workspace integrity
5. Commit in three separate domain-focused commits

## Implementation Summary

### Step 1: Remove Application Directory

Removed the entire `apps/orca-grid-be/` directory including:

- project.json (Nx configuration)
- pom.xml (Maven configuration)
- README.md (Application documentation)
- .gitignore
- Source files (Java application, tests, resources)

### Step 2: Update System Architecture Documentation

Cleaned up `docs/reference/re__system-architecture.md` by removing:

- Application count updated: 8 → 4 applications
- Deployment updated: Removed Kubernetes references (Vercel-only now)
- C4 Level 1 diagram: Removed K8S_CLUSTER, CONTAINER_REGISTRY, ENTERPRISES, PROD_TEAM
- Applications Inventory: Removed orca-grid-fe, orca-grid-be, orca-grid-be-e2e, orca-grid-fe-e2e sections
- C4 Level 2 diagram: Removed "Orca Grid Application Suite" subgraph
- Application Interactions: Removed Orca Grid runtime dependencies
- C4 Level 3: Removed orca-grid-be and orca-grid-fe component diagrams
- C4 Level 4: Removed database schemas, class structures, sequence diagrams
- Deployment Architecture: Removed K8s cluster references
- CI/CD Pipelines: Removed orca-grid E2E test references
- Technology Stack: Removed Java/Spring Boot, Playwright references
- Future Architecture: Removed Orca Grid completion sections

**Result**: 857 lines removed (~44% reduction), file reduced from 1,946 to 1,089 lines

### Step 3: Update Plan History

Updated two plan history files:

1. `plans/done/README.md`: Added removal note to dolphin-be entry
2. `plans/done/2026-01-17__dolphin-be-init/README.md`: Added removal note to Historical Note section
3. Created `plans/done/2026-02-14__orca-grid-be-removal/` with complete removal plan documentation

### Step 4: Verify Workspace Integrity

Verification commands executed successfully:

- `nx show projects`: Confirmed orca-grid-be not listed (4 projects: ose-platform-web, ayokoding-fs, ayokoding-cli, rhino-cli)
- `nx graph`: Verified no broken dependencies
- `nx build [app]`: All 4 apps built successfully
- `nx test [app]`: All tests passed (ayokoding-cli, rhino-cli)
- `grep` searches: Confirmed only expected references remain (in plans/done/ for historical context)

### Step 5: Quality Gates

Executed markdown quality checks:

- `npm run lint:md:fix`: All markdown files validated and fixed
- `npm run format:md`: All markdown files formatted

### Step 6: Git Commits

Created three separate commits following Conventional Commits format:

1. **Application removal** (feat, breaking change)
2. **Documentation updates** (docs)
3. **Plan history updates** (docs)

## Critical Files Modified

1. **apps/orca-grid-be/** - Entire directory removed (DELETE)
2. **docs/reference/re\_\_system-architecture.md** - Removed ~90 orca-grid references (EDIT, 857 lines removed)
3. **plans/done/README.md** - Added removal note (EDIT)
4. **plans/done/2026-01-17\_\_dolphin-be-init/README.md** - Added removal note (EDIT)
5. **plans/done/2026-02-14\_\_orca-grid-be-removal/** - Created new plan directory (CREATE)
   - README.md - This plan (CREATE)
   - requirements.md - Removal rationale (CREATE)
   - delivery.md - Verification steps (CREATE)

## Verification Results

### Build Verification ✓

All apps built successfully:

- ose-platform-web (Hugo site)
- ayokoding-fs (Hugo site)
- ayokoding-cli (Go CLI)
- rhino-cli (Go CLI)

### Test Verification ✓

All tests passed:

- ayokoding-cli (Go tests)
- rhino-cli (Go tests)

### Nx Workspace Verification ✓

- Project list: 4 projects (orca-grid-be NOT present)
- Dependency graph: Clean, no broken dependencies

### Documentation Verification ✓

- Zero orca-grid references in `docs/` directory (excluding metadata)
- Only expected references in `plans/done/` (historical context)

### Quality Gate Verification ✓

- Markdown linting: Zero errors
- Markdown formatting: All files formatted correctly

### Git Verification ✓

Three commits created in sequence:

1. docs(plans): document orca-grid-be removal in plan history
2. docs(reference): remove orca-grid suite from system architecture
3. feat(monorepo)!: remove orca-grid-be application

## Outcome

Successfully removed orca-grid-be application and all related documentation, simplifying the monorepo to focus on 4 active applications while preserving historical context for future reference.

**Monorepo Focus**: 2 Hugo static sites + 2 Go CLI tools
**Documentation Quality**: Clean, accurate, focused on actual implementation
**Historical Context**: Preserved in plan history for future decisions
