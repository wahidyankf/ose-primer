**Result**: ✓ Documentation cleaned successfully, agent-assisted comprehensive cleanup

### ✓ Step 3: Update Plan History

**Files Updated**:

1. `plans/done/README.md`:
   - Line 7: Added removal note to dolphin-be entry
   - Note: "Application removed 2026-02-14 as no longer needed. (Completed: 2026-01-17, Removed: 2026-02-14)"

2. `plans/done/2026-01-17__dolphin-be-init/README.md`:
   - Line 3: Updated Historical Note with removal context
   - Note: "The application was removed on 2026-02-14 as it was no longer needed."

3. `plans/done/2026-02-14__orca-grid-be-removal/`:
   - Created new plan directory
   - Files: README.md, requirements.md, delivery.md

**Result**: ✓ Plan history updated successfully

### ✓ Step 4: Verify Workspace Integrity

**Verification Commands**:

```bash
# Verify project list
nx show projects
# Expected: ose-platform-web, ayokoding-fs, ayokoding-cli, rhino-cli

# Verify dependency graph
nx graph
# Expected: Clean graph, no broken dependencies

# Build all apps
nx build ose-platform-web
nx build ayokoding-fs
nx build ayokoding-cli
nx build rhino-cli
# Expected: All builds succeed

# Run tests
nx test ayokoding-cli
nx test rhino-cli
# Expected: All tests pass

# Search for remaining references
grep -r "orca-grid-be" . --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git
grep -r "orca-grid-fe" . --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git
grep -r "orca-grid" . --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git
# Expected: Only references in plans/done/ for historical context
```

**Results**:

- ✓ `nx show projects`: Lists exactly 4 projects (orca-grid-be NOT present)
- ✓ `nx graph`: Clean dependency graph, no errors
- ✓ Build verification: All 4 applications build successfully
- ✓ Test verification: All tests pass (ayokoding-cli, rhino-cli)
- ✓ Reference search: Only expected historical references in plans/done/

### ✓ Step 5: Run Quality Gates

**Commands**:

```bash
npm run lint:md:fix
npm run format:md
```

**Results**:

- ✓ Markdown linting: Zero violations
- ✓ Markdown formatting: All files formatted correctly

### ✓ Step 6: Create Git Commits

**Commit 1 - Application Removal**:

```bash
git rm -rf apps/orca-grid-be
git commit -m "feat(monorepo)!: remove orca-grid-be application

BREAKING CHANGE: Remove orca-grid-be Spring Boot application as it is no longer needed.

The application was initially created as dolphin-be for LMS, renamed to orca-grid-be for KMS,
but never developed beyond initial setup. Removing to keep monorepo focused on active projects.

Related apps (orca-grid-fe, orca-grid-be-e2e, orca-grid-fe-e2e) were planned but never created.

Refs: plans/done/2026-01-17__dolphin-be-init/, plans/done/2026-02-14__orca-grid-be-removal/"
```

**Commit 2 - Documentation Updates**:

```bash
git add docs/reference/re__system-architecture.md
git commit -m "docs(reference): remove orca-grid suite from system architecture

Remove all references to Orca Grid application suite (orca-grid-be, orca-grid-fe,
orca-grid-be-e2e, orca-grid-fe-e2e) from system architecture documentation.

Updates:
- Application count: 8 → 4 actual applications
- Deployment: Removed Kubernetes references (Vercel-only now)
- Technology stack: Removed Java/Spring Boot, Playwright testing
- Diagrams: Removed Orca Grid components from C4 diagrams
- Simplified to reflect actual system state (Hugo sites + Go CLIs)

Refs: plans/done/2026-02-14__orca-grid-be-removal/"
```

**Commit 3 - Plan History Updates**:

```bash
git add plans/done/README.md plans/done/2026-01-17__dolphin-be-init/README.md plans/done/2026-02-14__orca-grid-be-removal/
git commit -m "docs(plans): document orca-grid-be removal in plan history

Update plan history to document removal of orca-grid-be application while preserving
historical context. Create new removal plan for future reference.

Changes:
- Update plans/done/README.md with removal note
- Update plans/done/2026-01-17__dolphin-be-init/README.md with removal note
- Create plans/done/2026-02-14__orca-grid-be-removal/ with complete removal plan

Refs: plans/done/2026-01-17__dolphin-be-init/"
```

**Results**:

- ✓ Three commits created successfully
- ✓ Conventional Commits format validated
- ✓ Clean git history with domain separation

  - `plans/done/2026-01-17__dolphin-be-init/README.md` (historical context + removal note)
  - `plans/done/2026-02-14__orca-grid-be-removal/` (this plan)

### Quality Gate Verification ✓

- **Markdown Linting**: ✓ Zero errors
- **Markdown Formatting**: ✓ All files formatted

### Git History Verification ✓

**Commits Created**:

1. ✓ docs(plans): document orca-grid-be removal in plan history
2. ✓ docs(reference): remove orca-grid suite from system architecture
3. ✓ feat(monorepo)!: remove orca-grid-be application

**Commit Order**: Correct (reverse chronological as expected)

## Rollback Strategy

If rollback is needed (not required, but documented for completeness):

```bash
# Revert all three commits
git revert HEAD~2..HEAD

# Or revert individually
git revert <commit-hash-3>  # Plan history
git revert <commit-hash-2>  # Documentation
git revert <commit-hash-1>  # Application

# Or restore to specific commit
git checkout <commit-hash> -- apps/orca-grid-be
```

**Recovery Time**: < 5 minutes (simple git operations)
**Data Loss Risk**: None (application was never deployed to production)

## Outcome

✓ **Success**: All acceptance criteria met

- Application directory removed
- Documentation cleaned (857 lines removed, ~44% reduction)
- Plan history updated with removal notes
- Workspace integrity verified (4 apps build/test successfully)
- Quality gates passed (zero markdown violations)
- Three clean commits created

**Monorepo Now Focused On**:

- 2 Hugo static sites (ose-platform-web, ayokoding-fs)
- 2 Go CLI tools (ayokoding-cli, rhino-cli)

**Documentation Quality**: Accurate, concise, reflects actual implementation
**Historical Context**: Preserved for future reference in plan history
