# Delivery Plan: Standardize Programming Language Content Quality

## Overview

**Delivery Type**: Direct to Main (5 Sequential Phases)

**Git Workflow**: Trunk Based Development (direct commits to `main`)

All implementation happens on the `main` branch using Trunk Based Development workflow with direct commits. No PRs or feature branches. See [Trunk Based Development Convention](../../../governance/development/workflow/trunk-based-development.md) for complete details.

**Summary**: This plan delivers 37 new how-to guides and ~5,740 lines of cookbook content across 5 programming languages (Java, Golang, Python, Kotlin, Rust) through 5 sequential phases prioritized by gap size. Each phase commits directly to `main` upon completion.

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

**Phase Dependencies**:

- Phase 2 (Golang) can start only after Phase 1 (Java) is completed and committed to main
- Phase 3 (Python) can start only after Phase 2 (Golang) is completed and committed to main
- Phase 4 (Kotlin) can start only after Phase 3 (Python) is completed and committed to main
- Phase 5 (Rust) can start only after Phase 4 (Kotlin) is completed and committed to main

**Rationale**: Sequential delivery allows learning from earlier phases to improve later phases.

**Content Dependencies**:

- Cross-references require existing content to be stable
- Cookbook recipes reference how-to guides (must create guides first within each phase)
- How-to guides reference tutorial sections (tutorials already exist, no blocking)

### External Dependencies

**Development Tools**:

- Java: OpenJDK 25 LTS installed for testing code examples (with Java 21 LTS for compatibility testing)
- Golang: Go 1.25+ installed for testing code examples
- Python: Python 3.14+ installed for testing code examples
- Kotlin: Kotlin 2.3+ installed for testing code examples
- Rust: Rust 1.92+ installed for testing code examples

**AI Agents**:

- ayokoding-fs-general-maker available and functional
- ayokoding-fs-general-checker available and functional
- ayokoding-fs-facts-checker available and functional
- ayokoding-fs-link-checker available and functional
- ayokoding-fs-general-fixer available and functional

**Hugo Build**:

- Hugo extended version installed
- Hextra theme properly configured
- Mermaid support enabled

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Inconsistent Quality Across Languages

**Risk**: Later phases may have different quality than earlier phases.

**Impact**: High - undermines goal of universal standard

**Mitigation**:

- Use earlier phases as templates for later phases
- Review earlier PRs for patterns and lessons learned
- Maintain consistent validation process (same agents, same criteria)
- Document quality patterns discovered in Phase 1 for reuse

**Contingency**: If quality drift detected, pause to align standards before continuing. May revert commits if necessary.

### Risk 2: Validation Agent Issues

**Risk**: Validation agents may have bugs or miss issues.

**Impact**: Medium - invalid content may pass validation

**Mitigation**:

- Manual review required in addition to automated validation
- Test agents on sample content before running on full phases
- Cross-validate findings (e.g., facts-checker and manual testing)
- Report agent issues to agent-maker for fixes

**Contingency**: If agent critical failure, perform manual validation as backup. Revert commits if critical issues discovered post-commit.

### Risk 3: Code Example Failures

**Risk**: Code examples may not work in all environments or versions.

**Impact**: High - breaks learner trust and experience

**Mitigation**:

- Test all code examples in clean development environments
- Document version requirements explicitly
- Test on multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) where applicable
- Include expected output in documentation

**Contingency**: If code fails, debug and fix before merging. Use feature flag to hide broken content if needed.

### Risk 4: Scope Creep

**Risk**: Temptation to modify existing content beyond validation fixes.

**Impact**: Medium - expands scope unpredictably, delays completion

**Mitigation**:

- Strict adherence to "new content only" rule
- Validation fixes only (factual errors, accessibility issues)
- Document any non-trivial changes for review
- Separate refactoring work into future plans

**Contingency**: If scope creep occurs, move extra work to separate plan.

### Risk 5: Hugo Build Failures

**Risk**: Content may break Hugo build or cause rendering issues.

**Impact**: High - blocks deployment

**Mitigation**:

- Test Hugo build locally before pushing
- Validate frontmatter syntax (YAML)
- Check weight uniqueness within parent directories
- Monitor build logs for warnings

**Contingency**: If build fails, revert commit and debug before re-committing.

### Risk 6: Cross-Reference Complexity

**Risk**: Managing cross-references across 33 guides and cookbook expansions may be error-prone.

**Impact**: Medium - broken links, poor navigation

**Mitigation**:

- Use ayokoding-fs-link-checker to validate all links
- Follow consistent linking pattern (relative paths with .md extension)
- Document cross-reference strategy per phase
- Review cross-references manually in addition to automated checks

**Contingency**: If cross-reference issues found post-commit, create fix commit immediately.

**Phase Status**:

- [x] Phase 1: Java - Implementation Complete, Ready for Validation
- [x] Phase 2: Golang - Implementation Complete, Ready for Validation
- [x] Phase 3: Python - Implementation Complete, Ready for Validation
- [x] Phase 4: Kotlin - Implementation Complete, Ready for Validation
- [x] Phase 5: Rust - Implementation Complete, Ready for Validation

**Next Steps**:

The implementation is complete and ready for comprehensive final validation. To proceed:

1. **Run Validation Agents** (requires user to invoke separately):
   - `ayokoding-fs-general-checker` on each language directory to validate Hugo conventions, frontmatter, and structure
   - `ayokoding-fs-facts-checker` on all new guides to verify code examples, versions, and commands
   - `ayokoding-fs-link-checker` on all new guides to verify cross-references meet minimum requirements

2. **Address Issues**: Review validation reports and fix any critical issues found

3. **Manual Testing**: Test sample code examples in development environments

4. **Final Review**: Complete pedagogical effectiveness review

5. **Mark Complete**: After all validations pass, mark plan as complete and ready for deployment

**Implementation Status**: All 37 guides created, all cookbooks expanded. Frontmatter cleaned. Hugo build successful. Ready for validation phase.
