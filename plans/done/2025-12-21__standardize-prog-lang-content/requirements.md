# Requirements: Standardize Programming Language Content Quality

## Objectives

### Primary Objectives

**OBJ-1: Achieve Universal How-To Guide Count Standard**

Bring all 5 programming languages to 23 how-to guides each (stretch goal exceeding 18+ exceptional standard).

**Rationale**: While the Programming Language Content Standard defines 18+ guides as "exceptional", Kotlin's existing 22 guides demonstrate that 23 is achievable and provides more comprehensive coverage across common development patterns. This plan sets 23 as a stretch goal to match the highest current implementation.

**Success Criteria**:

- Java: 11 → 23 guides (add 12)
- Golang: 13 → 23 guides (add 10)
- Python: 15 → 23 guides (add 8)
- Kotlin: 21 → 23 guides (add 2)
- Rust: 18 → 23 guides (add 5)

**OBJ-2: Achieve Universal Cookbook Quality Standard**

Bring all 5 programming languages to 5,000+ line cookbooks (matching Java/Golang exceptional level).

**Success Criteria**:

- Kotlin: 2,669 → 5,000+ lines (add ~2,330 lines, ~15-20 recipes)
- Rust: 2,243 → 5,000+ lines (add ~2,760 lines, ~18-23 recipes)
- Python: 4,351 → 5,000+ lines (add ~650 lines, ~4-5 recipes)
- Java: 5,367 lines (maintain, optional small additions)
- Golang: 5,169 lines (maintain, optional small additions)

**OBJ-3: Validate All Content Against Programming Language Content Standard**

Ensure all content meets quality benchmarks defined in the standard.

**Success Criteria**:

- All Mermaid diagrams use color-blind friendly palette (Blue #0173B2, Orange #DE8F05, Teal #029E73, Purple #CC78BC, Brown #CA9161)
- All code examples are runnable and tested
- All how-to guides follow mandatory pattern (Problem → Solution → How It Works → Variations → Common Pitfalls → Related Patterns)
- Cross-references properly connect tutorials, how-to guides, and cookbooks
- No time estimates in any educational content
- All content passes ayokoding-fs-general-checker, ayokoding-fs-facts-checker, ayokoding-fs-link-checker validation

### Secondary Objectives

**OBJ-4: Improve Cross-Referencing Quality**

Enhance connections between tutorials, how-to guides, and cookbooks across all languages.

**Success Criteria**:

- Each how-to guide references at least 2 related tutorial sections
- Each how-to guide references at least 1 cookbook recipe
- Cookbook recipes reference relevant how-to guides and tutorial sections

**OBJ-5: Strengthen Factual Accuracy**

Verify and correct all technical information across all languages.

**Success Criteria**:

- All command syntax verified against official documentation
- All version numbers current and accurate
- All code examples tested and working
- All external references validated

## User Stories

### Story 1: Consistent Learning Experience

**As a** software engineer learning multiple programming languages
**I want** consistent educational quality across all languages
**So that** I can trust the content quality regardless of which language I choose to learn

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Scenario: Learner compares how-to guide quality across languages
  Given I am viewing how-to guides for Java, Golang, Python, Kotlin, and Rust
  When I compare the number of guides across languages
  Then all 5 languages should have exactly 23 how-to guides
  And all guides should follow the same structure (Problem, Solution, How It Works, Variations, Common Pitfalls, Related Patterns)
  And all guides should have runnable code examples
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Learner compares cookbook quality across languages
  Given I am viewing cookbooks for Java, Golang, Python, Kotlin, and Rust
  When I compare the cookbook lengths across languages
  Then all 5 languages should have cookbooks with 5,000+ lines
  And all cookbooks should have 30+ recipes minimum
  And all recipes should follow the same format (Problem, Solution, How It Works, Use Cases)
```

### Story 2: Accessible Visual Content

**As a** learner with color blindness
**I want** all diagrams to use color-blind friendly colors
**So that** I can perceive visual information without barriers

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Scenario: Color-blind learner views Mermaid diagrams
  Given I have protanopia (red-green color blindness)
  And I am viewing a Mermaid diagram in any programming language guide
  When I examine the colors used in the diagram
  Then all colors should be from the approved palette: Blue (#0173B2), Orange (#DE8F05), Teal (#029E73), Purple (#CC78BC), Brown (#CA9161)
  And the diagram should use shape differentiation (not color alone)
  And the diagram should have clear text labels
  And I can distinguish all elements without relying on color
```

### Story 3: Quick Problem Solving

**As a** developer facing a specific programming problem
**I want** comprehensive how-to guides covering common patterns
**So that** I can find solutions quickly without searching external resources

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Scenario: Developer searches for performance optimization guidance
  Given I am working with Golang/Java/Python/Kotlin/Rust
  And I need to optimize performance
  When I navigate to the how-to guides section
  Then I should find an "optimize-performance.md" guide
  And the guide should have a clear problem statement
  And the guide should provide step-by-step solution
  And the guide should explain how the solution works
  And the guide should show alternative approaches with trade-offs
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Developer searches for database integration patterns
  Given I am working with Golang/Java/Python/Kotlin/Rust
  And I need to integrate with a database
  When I navigate to the how-to guides section
  Then I should find a "work-with-databases.md" guide
  And the guide should have runnable code examples
  And the guide should cover common database operations
  And the guide should link to related cookbook recipes
```

### Story 4: Copy-Paste Ready Recipes

**As a** developer building a feature
**I want** copy-paste ready code recipes in the cookbook
**So that** I can implement common patterns quickly without reinventing solutions

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Scenario: Developer finds and uses cookbook recipe
  Given I need to implement error handling in Kotlin
  When I open the Kotlin cookbook
  Then I should find 30+ recipes organized by category
  And the error handling category should have multiple recipes
  And each recipe should have complete, runnable code
  And I can copy the code and adapt it to my use case
  And the recipe should explain how the code works
  And the recipe should reference related how-to guides
```

### Story 5: Validated Technical Accuracy

**As a** learner relying on documentation
**I want** all code examples and commands to be accurate and tested
**So that** I don't waste time debugging incorrect documentation

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Scenario: Learner follows code example from how-to guide
  Given I am reading a how-to guide for any language
  When I copy a code example from the guide
  And I run the code in my development environment
  Then the code should execute without errors
  And the output should match what the guide describes
  And the code should work on Windows, macOS, and Linux (where applicable)
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Learner verifies command syntax
  Given I am reading installation or setup instructions
  When I execute a command shown in the documentation
  Then the command should be valid for the current version of the language/tool
  And the command should work as described
  And version numbers should be current and accurate
```

## Out of Scope

**OUT-1: Tutorial Content Changes**

This plan does NOT modify tutorial content (Initial Setup, Quick Start, Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced tutorials).

**Rationale**: Focus is on how-to guides and cookbooks only.

**OUT-2: Best Practices and Anti-Patterns**

This plan does NOT modify explanation documents (best-practices.md, anti-patterns.md).

**Rationale**: Focus is on how-to guides and cookbooks only.

**OUT-3: Indonesian Translation**

This plan does NOT include Indonesian language content.

**Rationale**: Focus is on English content quality first. Translation is a separate effort.

**OUT-4: Reference Documentation**

This plan does NOT create API reference documentation.

**Rationale**: Reference directories are placeholders for future API docs.

**OUT-5: New Programming Languages**

This plan does NOT add new programming languages beyond the existing 5.

**Rationale**: Standardize existing languages first before expansion.

**OUT-6: Existing Content Refactoring**

This plan does NOT refactor or rewrite existing how-to guides or cookbook recipes (except for validation fixes).

**Rationale**: Focus is on filling gaps (new content) rather than improving existing content.
