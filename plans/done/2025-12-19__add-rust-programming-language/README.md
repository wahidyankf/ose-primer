# Add Rust Programming Language

**Status**: Done
**Completed**: 2026-01-10

**Created**: 2025-12-19

**Delivery Type**: Single-PR Plan

**Git Workflow**: Trunk Based Development (work on `main` branch)

## Overview

This plan outlines the comprehensive implementation of Rust programming language content on ayokoding-fs to meet the highest standards defined in the [Programming Language Content Standard](../../../governance/conventions/tutorials/programming-language-content.md). The project delivers production-ready Rust content with complete tutorials (5 levels), cookbook (30-35 recipes), how-to guides (18), reference documentation, and philosophy sections.

### Goals

1. **Deliver Complete Rust Content**: Create all 5 tutorial levels meeting line count benchmarks
2. **Build Comprehensive Cookbook**: 30-35 recipes covering Rust patterns (4,000-5,500 lines)
3. **Create Practical How-To Guides**: 18 problem-solving guides for Rust-specific challenges
4. **Develop Complete Reference Section**: Cheat sheet, glossary, and resources documentation
5. **Document Rust Philosophy**: Overview, best practices, and anti-patterns emphasizing ownership, safety, and performance
6. **Validate Thoroughly**: Pass all checker agents (content, facts, links) before deployment

### Context

Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, concurrency, and performance. It introduces unique concepts (ownership, borrowing, lifetimes) that require careful pedagogical treatment. Rust's growing adoption in systems programming, WebAssembly, blockchain, and cloud infrastructure makes it essential for ayokoding-fs's programming language coverage.

**Rust's Unique Value Proposition:**

- **Memory Safety Without GC**: Ownership system prevents memory bugs at compile time
- **Fearless Concurrency**: Type system prevents data races
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: High-level features with no runtime overhead
- **Growing Ecosystem**: Cargo, crates.io, strong tooling (rustfmt, clippy)
- **Industry Adoption**: Used by Mozilla, Microsoft, Amazon, Dropbox, Discord

**Estimated Work**: ~520KB of new content across all categories.

### Success Criteria

Rust language achieves:

- ✅ All 5 tutorial levels meeting line count benchmarks (initial-setup through advanced)
- ✅ Complete reference section (cheat-sheet, glossary, resources)
- ✅ 30-35 recipe cookbook (4,000-5,500 lines)
- ✅ 18 how-to guides covering Rust-specific patterns
- ✅ Enhanced philosophy sections (overview, best-practices, anti-patterns)
- ✅ Pass ayokoding-fs-general-checker validation
- ✅ Pass ayokoding-fs-facts-checker verification
- ✅ Pass ayokoding-fs-link-checker validation

## Plan Structure

This plan is organized into multiple documents:

- **[requirements.md](./requirements.md)** - Objectives, user stories, functional requirements, constraints
- **[tech-docs.md](./tech-docs.md)** - Architecture, implementation approach, Rust-specific considerations
- **[delivery.md](./delivery.md)** - Implementation phases, validation strategy, completion checklist
