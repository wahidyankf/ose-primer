# Delivery Plan

## Overview

### Delivery Type

**Single-PR Plan** - All Rust content delivered in one comprehensive pull request

Rationale:

- Rust content forms cohesive learning path with extensive cross-references
- Ownership concepts progress across all categories (cannot be split)
- Single review ensures consistent quality and pedagogical approach
- Complete learning experience available immediately upon merge

### Git Workflow

**Trunk Based Development** - All work happens on `main` branch

- No feature branches (work directly on main)
- Small, frequent commits by content category
- Push regularly (daily if possible)
- No feature flags needed (content complete before merge)

### Summary

This plan delivers comprehensive Rust programming language content to ayokoding-fs, meeting the highest standard defined in the Programming Language Content Standard. Total work: ~520KB (~20,000 lines) of new content across tutorials, cookbook, how-to guides, reference, and philosophy sections.

**Content Breakdown**:

- **Tutorials**: ~5,500 lines (5 levels from initial-setup to advanced)
- **Cookbook**: ~4,500 lines (30-35 recipes with ownership focus)
- **How-To Guides**: ~7,200 lines (18 problem-solving guides)
- **Reference**: ~1,300 lines (cheat-sheet, glossary, resources)
- **Philosophy**: ~1,500 lines (overview, best-practices, anti-patterns)

**Unique Rust Considerations**:

- Ownership system requires careful pedagogical treatment
- Progressive disclosure from move semantics to lifetime annotations
- Extensive Mermaid diagrams for ownership visualization
- Edition-specific content (Rust 2024)
- Ecosystem coverage (Cargo, async, FFI, WebAssembly, embedded)

##### Step 2.8.6: Cross-Reference Quality Verification

After adding all cross-references, verify:

- [x] **Bidirectional completeness**:
  - [x] If tutorial links to guide, guide links back to tutorial
  - [x] If cookbook links to tutorial, tutorial links to cookbook
  - [x] If best-practices links to content, anti-patterns links to contrasting content

- [x] **Link format correctness**:
  - [x] All links use absolute paths: `/en/learn/swe/programming-languages/rust/...`
  - [x] No `.md` extensions in links
  - [x] All links include proper display text (not bare URLs)
  - [x] Links to specific sections use anchor format: `#section-heading`

- [x] **Contextual relevance**:
  - [x] Links appear in relevant sections (not just dumped at end)
  - [x] Link text describes destination clearly
  - [x] "Learn More" sections group related links logically
  - [x] Links add value (not redundant or tangential)

- [x] **Cross-reference density**:
  - [x] Each tutorial has 5-15 outbound cross-references
  - [x] Each cookbook recipe has 2-4 "Learn More" links
  - [x] Each how-to guide has 3-5 "Background Knowledge" links
  - [x] Philosophy docs reference concrete examples liberally

- [x] **Navigation clarity**:
  - [x] Progressive learning path is clear (beginner → intermediate → advanced)
  - [x] Lateral connections visible (tutorials ↔ cookbook ↔ guides)
  - [x] Reference materials easily accessible from all content
  - [x] No orphaned content (every file reachable via cross-references)

**Cross-Reference Output**: Interconnected Rust content with clear learning paths and easy navigation between related topics.

#### Step 2.9: Code Example Standards and Patterns

All Rust code examples must follow consistent quality standards to ensure they compile, follow best practices, and serve as good learning resources. Examples must be formatted with rustfmt, pass clippy lints, and follow Rust 2024 edition idioms.

##### Step 2.9.1: Code Formatting Standards

**rustfmt Configuration** (all examples MUST be formatted with rustfmt):

- [x] Use default rustfmt configuration (Rust 2024 edition)
- [x] Run `rustfmt --edition 2024` on all code examples
- [x] Verify formatting before adding to content
- [x] Line length: 100 characters (rustfmt default)
- [x] Indentation: 4 spaces (Rust standard)
- [x] Trailing commas: Yes (for multi-line)

**Code Block Syntax** (Hugo markdown):

- [x] Use triple backticks with `rust` language identifier: ` ```rust `
- [x] Add `{filename="main.rs"}` for file context when helpful
- [x] Add `{linenos=true}` for longer examples (>20 lines)
- [x] Use `{hl_lines=[3,5-7]}` to highlight key lines when explaining specific concepts

**Example Code Block Format**:

````markdown
```rust {filename="src/main.rs" linenos=true}
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    println!("{}", s);
}
```
````

##### Step 2.9.2: Example Classification and Structure

**Three Example Types** (use appropriate type for context):

**Type 1: Minimal Examples** (10-20 lines) - For introducing single concepts

- [x] **Purpose**: Demonstrate one specific concept clearly
- [x] **Scope**: Single function or small struct
- [x] **Context**: No external dependencies, std library only
- [x] **Usage**: Initial introductions, quick demonstrations
- [x] **Example structure**:

  ```rust
  // Brief comment explaining the concept
  fn example_function() {
      // Minimal code demonstrating concept
  }
  ```

**Type 2: Comprehensive Examples** (30-80 lines) - For showing complete patterns

- [x] **Purpose**: Show real-world usage pattern
- [x] **Scope**: Multiple functions, struct with methods, or small module
- [x] **Context**: May include common crates (serde, tokio, etc.)
- [x] **Usage**: Tutorial sections, how-to guides, cookbook recipes
- [x] **Example structure**:

  ```rust
  // Module-level documentation

  // Imports (if needed)
  use std::collections::HashMap;

  // Type definitions
  struct Example {
      field: String,
  }

  // Implementation
  impl Example {
      fn new(field: String) -> Self {
          Self { field }
      }
  }

  // Demonstration/test
  fn main() {
      // Usage example
  }
  ```

**Type 3: Complete Programs** (50-150 lines) - For application examples

- [x] **Purpose**: Demonstrate complete, runnable application
- [x] **Scope**: Full application with error handling
- [x] **Context**: Production-like code with proper structure
- [x] **Usage**: Advanced tutorials, CLI/web app guides
- [x] **Example structure**:

  ```rust
  //! Program documentation

  use std::error::Error;

  // Module organization
  mod config;
  mod handler;

  // Main entry point with error handling
  fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
      // Application logic
      Ok(())
  }

  // Helper modules with documentation
  mod config {
      // Configuration code
  }

  mod handler {
      // Business logic
  }
  ```

##### Step 2.9.3: Comment and Documentation Standards

**Inline Comments** (explain non-obvious logic):

- [x] Use `//` for single-line explanations
- [x] Place comments above the code they explain
- [x] Explain _why_, not _what_ (code should be self-explanatory)
- [x] Keep comments concise (1-2 lines maximum)
- [x] Avoid redundant comments (e.g., `// Create a string` for `let s = String::new();`)

**Documentation Comments** (for public items):

- [x] Use `///` for item documentation
- [x] Use `//!` for module/crate documentation
- [x] Follow format: one-line summary, then detailed explanation
- [x] Include `# Examples` section for public functions
- [x] Include `# Panics` section if function can panic
- [x] Include `# Errors` section for functions returning `Result`

**Example Documentation Pattern**:

````rust
/// Calculates the area of a rectangle.
///
/// This function takes the width and height as parameters
/// and returns the calculated area.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let area = calculate_area(5, 10);
/// assert_eq!(area, 50);
/// ```
fn calculate_area(width: u32, height: u32) -> u32 {
    width * height
}
````

##### Step 2.9.4: Error Handling in Examples

**Error Handling Progression** (introduce complexity gradually):

**Level 1: panic! and unwrap()** (Initial Setup, Quick Start only):

- [x] Use for first examples to avoid overwhelming beginners
- [x] Always include comment: `// In production, use proper error handling`
- [x] Example: `let file = File::open("data.txt").unwrap();`

**Level 2: expect()** (Beginner tutorial):

- [x] Prefer over unwrap() for better error messages
- [x] Use descriptive messages
- [x] Example: `let file = File::open("data.txt").expect("Failed to open data file");`

**Level 3: Result and ?** (Beginner onwards):

- [x] Use from Beginner tutorial Section 10 onward
- [x] Show full error propagation pattern
- [x] Example:

  ```rust
  fn read_file(path: &str) -> Result<String, std::io::Error> {
      let contents = std::fs::read_to_string(path)?;
      Ok(contents)
  }
  ```

**Level 4: Custom Errors** (Intermediate, Advanced, How-To guides):

- [x] Use thiserror or custom Error types
- [x] Show full error handling patterns
- [x] Include error context
- [x] Example using thiserror:

  ```rust
  use thiserror::Error;

  #[derive(Error, Debug)]
  enum DataError {
      #[error("Failed to read file: {0}")]
      IoError(#[from] std::io::Error),
      #[error("Invalid data format")]
      ParseError,
  }
  ```

##### Step 2.9.5: Clippy and Best Practice Requirements

**clippy Validation** (all examples MUST pass):

- [x] Run `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` on all examples
- [x] Fix all clippy warnings (zero tolerance)
- [x] Common clippy rules to follow:
  - [x] Use `if let` instead of `match` for single pattern
  - [x] Prefer `&str` over `&String` in function parameters
  - [x] Use `.is_empty()` instead of `.len() == 0`
  - [x] Avoid redundant closures
  - [x] Use explicit return types for public functions

**Naming Conventions** (follow Rust API guidelines):

- [x] Types: `PascalCase` (structs, enums, traits)
- [x] Functions/variables: `snake_case`
- [x] Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
- [x] Lifetimes: single lowercase letter (`'a`, `'b`)
- [x] Type parameters: single uppercase letter (`T`, `E`, `K`, `V`)

**Ownership Clarity** (critical for Rust examples):

- [x] Make ownership transfer explicit with comments when teaching
- [x] Show both owned and borrowed versions when helpful
- [x] Use descriptive variable names that hint at ownership (e.g., `owned_string`, `borrowed_slice`)
- [x] Example:

  ```rust
  fn takes_ownership(s: String) { /* s is moved here */ }
  fn borrows(s: &String) { /* s is borrowed, not moved */ }
  ```

##### Step 2.9.6: Platform and Edition Considerations

**Rust Edition Specification** (ALL examples use 2024 edition):

- [x] Specify edition in Cargo.toml examples: `edition = "2024"`
- [x] Use 2024 edition syntax and features
- [x] Avoid deprecated syntax from previous editions
- [x] Document edition-specific features when introduced

**Platform Compatibility** (examples MUST work on all platforms):

- [x] Test on macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
- [x] Test on Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)
- [x] Test on Windows (Windows 11)
- [x] Avoid platform-specific code unless in platform-specific guides
- [x] Use `std::path::PathBuf` instead of string paths for cross-platform compatibility
- [x] Use `std::env::consts::OS` when detecting platform is necessary

**Dependency Pinning** (for examples using external crates):

- [x] Specify exact versions in Cargo.toml examples
- [x] Use current stable versions (as of 2025-12-19)
- [x] Document minimum required Rust version (MSRV) if applicable
- [x] Example:

  ```toml
  [dependencies]
  serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
  tokio = { version = "1.35", features = ["full"] }
  ```

##### Step 2.9.7: Accessibility and Learning Enhancements

**Progressive Complexity** (build understanding gradually):

- [x] Start with simplest working example
- [x] Add complexity in stages with explanations
- [x] Show "before and after" for refactoring examples
- [x] Example progression:

  ```rust
  // Version 1: Basic (show first)
  let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];

  // Version 2: With iterator (introduce next)
  let numbers: Vec<i32> = (1..=3).collect();

  // Version 3: Functional style (show advanced)
  let numbers: Vec<i32> = (1..=3).filter(|&x| x > 0).collect();
  ```

**Visual Aids in Code** (enhance understanding):

- [x] Use ASCII art for data structure visualization when helpful
- [x] Add ownership flow comments for complex examples
- [x] Example with visual aid:

  ```rust
  // Ownership flow: main -> process_data -> consume
  //                  ↓
  //              [String moved here]
  fn consume(s: String) { }
  ```

**Runnable Examples** (enable learning by doing):

- [x] Ensure examples compile and run successfully
- [x] Include `main()` function for standalone examples
- [x] Show expected output in comments or prose
- [x] Example:

  ```rust
  fn main() {
      let result = calculate(5);
      println!("Result: {}", result);
      // Output: Result: 25
  }
  ```

##### Step 2.9.8: Code Example Quality Verification Checklist

Before including any code example in content, verify:

**Compilation and Testing**:

- [x] Example compiles with `rustc 1.85+` (Rust 2024 edition)
- [x] Example passes `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` (zero warnings)
- [x] Example formatted with `rustfmt --edition 2024`
- [x] Example tested on macOS, Linux, Windows (if applicable)

**Code Quality**:

- [x] Follows Rust naming conventions
- [x] Uses appropriate error handling for tutorial level
- [x] Includes helpful comments (explain why, not what)
- [x] Avoids deprecated syntax or antipatterns
- [x] Demonstrates idiomatic Rust style

**Pedagogical Value**:

- [x] Example focuses on one concept or pattern
- [x] Complexity appropriate for content section
- [x] Includes context (what problem it solves)
- [x] Shows expected output or behavior
- [x] Connects to surrounding explanation text

**Accessibility**:

- [x] Code is self-explanatory with good variable names
- [x] Complex logic has explanatory comments
- [x] Example is minimal (no unnecessary code)
- [x] Formatting enhances readability

**Output**: Consistent, high-quality code examples ready for validation

---

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Ownership Concepts Too Complex for Beginners

**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: High
**Severity**: HIGH

**Description**: Ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes may overwhelm beginners despite careful pedagogy.

**Mitigation**:

- Start with simple examples (integers, then String)
- Use extensive Mermaid diagrams for visualization
- Progressive disclosure (move → borrow → lifetimes)
- Acknowledge learning curve explicitly
- Provide many concrete examples before abstract rules
- Link to additional resources for struggling learners

**Contingency**: If user feedback indicates confusion, add supplementary explanation sections or standalone ownership tutorial

### Risk 2: Code Examples Fail to Compile on Some Platforms

**Probability**: Low
**Impact**: Critical
**Severity**: MEDIUM

**Description**: Rust code may have platform-specific issues (especially Windows)

**Mitigation**:

- Test all examples on macOS, Linux, Windows
- Use cross-platform APIs (avoid platform-specific libraries)
- Document platform differences where unavoidable
- Use Rust stable (most compatible)
- Verify rustup installation commands for all platforms

**Contingency**: If platform-specific issues found, clearly document workarounds or alternatives

### Risk 3: Future Rust Edition Changes

**Probability**: Low
**Impact**: Low
**Severity**: LOW

**Description**: Future Rust editions (post-2024) may introduce syntax changes or new features

**Mitigation**:

- Content clearly marked for 2024 edition
- Monitor Rust blog for edition announcements
- Edition markers allow for future updates
- All editions remain supported indefinitely
- 2024 edition is current and stable (released February 2025)

**Contingency**: If future edition stabilizes, assess impact and plan update in separate PR

### Risk 4: Async Ecosystem Complexity Confuses Learners

**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium
**Severity**: MEDIUM

**Description**: Async/await, Tokio, and async ecosystem may be too complex for Intermediate level

**Mitigation**:

- Cover async basics in Intermediate (enough to use)
- Deep-dive in Advanced (internals, Pin, Unpin)
- Use Tokio exclusively (avoid confusing with multiple runtimes)
- Show practical examples (async web server)
- Link to Async Book for comprehensive coverage

**Contingency**: If feedback indicates async section too complex, simplify Intermediate coverage and move more to Advanced

### Risk 5: Content Size Exceeds Hugo Performance Limits

**Probability**: Low
**Impact**: Low
**Severity**: LOW

**Description**: ~520KB of Rust content may impact build times or site performance

**Mitigation**:

- Hugo handles this content size easily (proven with other languages)
- Mermaid diagrams render client-side (no server load)
- Content is static (no dynamic rendering)
- Test Hugo build performance during validation

**Contingency**: If performance issues occur, investigate Hugo optimization options

### Risk 6: PR Review Bottleneck Due to Size

**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: Low
**Severity**: LOW

**Description**: Comprehensive PR (~20,000 lines) may take time to review

**Mitigation**:

- Provide detailed PR description with validation evidence
- Organize PR description by category (tutorials, cookbook, guides)
- All automated validation passed before submission
- Manual quality review complete before submission
- Clear documentation of Rust-specific considerations

**Contingency**: If review takes >1 week, offer to answer specific questions or provide focused reviews by section
