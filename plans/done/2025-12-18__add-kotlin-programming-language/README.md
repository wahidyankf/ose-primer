# Add Kotlin Programming Language to ayokoding-fs

**Status**: Implementation Complete - Ready for Validation

**Created**: 2025-12-18

**Delivery Type**: Single PR

**Git Workflow**: Trunk Based Development (work on `main` branch)

## Overview

This plan outlines the addition of comprehensive Kotlin programming language content to ayokoding-fs following the [Programming Language Content Standard](../../../governance/conventions/tutorials/programming-language-content.md). Kotlin will be implemented with all 5 tutorial levels, cookbook, how-to guides, and explanation documents, targeting 12,000-15,000 lines of production-ready educational content.

### Goals

1. **Complete Language Coverage**: Implement all 5 tutorial levels from initial setup (0-5%) through expert mastery (85-95%)
2. **Practical Reference**: Create cookbook with 30+ copy-paste recipes and 15+ problem-solving how-to guides
3. **Best Practices**: Document Kotlin idioms, conventions, and common pitfalls for developers migrating from Java
4. **Quality Compliance**: Meet Programming Language Content Standard benchmarks for line counts, cross-references, and pedagogical patterns
5. **Production Ready**: Pass all validation agents (content-checker, facts-checker, link-checker) before deployment

### Context

Kotlin is positioned as a modern, pragmatic programming language that addresses Java's verbosity while maintaining JVM interoperability. The content targets:

- **Java developers** migrating to Kotlin (smooth transition path)
- **Android developers** using Kotlin as the preferred platform language
- **Backend developers** exploring modern JVM alternatives
- **Multi-paradigm learners** interested in OOP + functional programming

**Unique Value Proposition**: Kotlin combines Java's ecosystem with modern language features (null safety, coroutines, concise syntax) - positioning it as "Java, but better" for contemporary development.

## Plan Structure

This plan is organized into multiple documents:

- **[requirements.md](./requirements.md)** - User stories, functional/non-functional requirements, constraints
- **[tech-docs.md](./tech-docs.md)** - Reference language selection, design decisions, implementation approach
- **[delivery.md](./delivery.md)** - Implementation phases, dependencies, risks, validation checklist
