```

## Functional Requirements

1. **Directory Structure**:
   - Create `apps/ayokoding-fs/content/en/learn/swe/programming-languages/kotlin/` with standard structure
   - Include tutorials/, how-to/, explanation/, reference/ subdirectories
   - All \_index.md and overview.md files for navigation

2. **Tutorial Levels**:
   - **Initial Setup** (0-5%): Installation, IntelliJ IDEA setup, first "Hello, World!", Gradle basics
   - **Quick Start** (5-30%): 8-12 touchpoints covering variables, null safety, functions, classes, collections, coroutines basics, packages, testing
   - **Beginner** (0-60%): Complete fundamentals - type system, OOP, functional programming basics, collections, error handling, file I/O, testing, package system
   - **Intermediate** (60-85%): Production patterns - coroutines/async, design patterns, performance, databases, REST APIs, configuration, security, testing strategies
   - **Advanced** (85-95%): Expert mastery - compiler internals, reflection, metaprogramming, advanced coroutines, performance optimization, debugging strategies, tooling

3. **Cookbook**:
   - 30+ recipes organized by 8 categories
   - Each recipe: Problem → Solution → How It Works → Use Cases → Variations
   - Categories: Data structures, Coroutines, Error handling, Design patterns, Web development, Database, Testing, Performance

4. **How-To Guides** (15 guides):
   - Avoid common null pointer errors
   - Use data classes effectively
   - Handle coroutines and async operations
   - Migrate Java code to Kotlin
   - Use sealed classes for type-safe state
   - Implement delegates and lazy initialization
   - Work with scope functions (let, apply, run, with, also)
   - Handle collections idiomatically
   - Write effective unit tests
   - Organize packages and modules
   - Manage dependencies with Gradle
   - Use inline functions and reified types
   - Handle Java interoperability
   - Optimize performance
   - Build REST APIs with Ktor

5. **Explanation Documents**:
   - **Best Practices**: Kotlin idioms, naming conventions, code organization, null safety patterns, coroutine best practices, testing, documentation, "What Makes Kotlin Special"
   - **Anti-Patterns**: Common mistakes from Java developers, null safety violations, coroutine pitfalls, performance anti-patterns, misusing language features

6. **Quality Requirements**:
   - All Mermaid diagrams use color-blind friendly palette (#0173B2, #DE8F05, #029E73, #CC78BC, #CA9161)
   - All code examples runnable and tested
   - No time estimates in content
   - Cross-references between tutorials, how-to guides, and cookbook
   - Factual accuracy verified via official Kotlin documentation

## Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance**:

- Hugo build time impact < 5 seconds for Kotlin content alone
- All code examples optimized for clarity and performance
- Page load time < 2 seconds for tutorial pages

**Accessibility**:

- WCAG AA compliance for all content
- Color-blind friendly diagrams only
- Alt text for all images
- Proper heading hierarchy

**Maintainability**:

- Consistent terminology across all documents
- Clear separation between beginner/intermediate/advanced concepts
- Version-agnostic content where possible (or specify Kotlin version)
- Easy to update when Kotlin evolves

**Scalability**:

- Structure allows easy addition of new how-to guides
- Cookbook can grow beyond 30 recipes
- Template can be reused for other JVM languages

## Constraints

1. **Content Standard Compliance**: Must follow Programming Language Content Standard exactly
2. **Hugo Convention Compliance**: Must follow ayokoding Hugo content conventions
3. **Line Count Targets**: Must meet minimum/target line counts per document type
4. **Reference Language**: Use Java as primary reference (closest match - both JVM, OOP)
5. **Validation Requirements**: Must pass all three validation agents before deployment
6. **Factual Accuracy**: All code must work with Kotlin 2.3.0 or later
7. **Trunk Based Development**: All work on main branch, no feature branches

## Assumptions

1. Target Kotlin version: 2.3.0+ (latest stable as of 2025-12-18)
2. Primary IDE: IntelliJ IDEA (free tier available)
3. Build tool: Gradle with Kotlin DSL (modern standard)
4. Java knowledge level: Assume readers may know Java (leverage for comparison)
5. Android context: Acknowledge Android as primary Kotlin use case but don't require Android knowledge
6. Time to complete: No estimates provided (respects No Time Estimates principle)

## Out of Scope

1. Kotlin Native (focus on JVM Kotlin only)
2. Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) - separate potential plan
3. Kotlin/JS (JavaScript compilation)
4. Advanced Android framework specifics (focus on language, not framework)
5. Kotlin Scripting (.kts files)
6. Compose Multiplatform UI framework
7. Translation to Indonesian (English only initially)
