## Dependencies

**Internal Dependencies**:

- Hugo site infrastructure (apps/ayokoding-fs)
- ayokoding-fs-general-maker agent (for content creation)
- ayokoding-fs-general-checker agent (for validation)
- ayokoding-fs-facts-checker agent (for verification)
- ayokoding-fs-link-checker agent (for link validation)
- ayokoding-fs-deployer agent (for deployment)
- Programming Language Content Standard convention (reference)
- Hugo Content Convention - ayokoding (reference)

**External Dependencies**:

- Kotlin 2.3.0+ official documentation (for factual accuracy)
- IntelliJ IDEA (for code testing)
- Gradle (for build examples)
- Official Kotlin website (for installation instructions)
- kotlinlang.org API documentation (for references)

## Risks and Mitigation

**Risk 1: Kotlin Evolution**

- **Risk**: Kotlin 2.x features change or get deprecated
- **Likelihood**: Medium (language evolves continuously)
- **Impact**: High (content becomes outdated)
- **Mitigation**: Target stable Kotlin 2.3.0+ features only, note version requirements explicitly, plan quarterly fact checks

**Risk 2: Content Scope Creep**

- **Risk**: Attempting to cover too much, exceeding target line counts significantly
- **Likelihood**: Medium (Kotlin has many features)
- **Impact**: Medium (delays completion, reduces quality)
- **Mitigation**: Strictly follow Programming Language Content Standard limits, prioritize essential topics, use "Out of Scope" list actively

**Risk 3: Code Example Errors**

- **Risk**: Code examples contain bugs or don't compile
- **Likelihood**: Medium (lots of code across multiple files)
- **Impact**: High (damages credibility, confuses learners)
- **Mitigation**: Test all examples in fresh Kotlin 2.3.0+ environment, use ayokoding-fs-facts-checker, manual review before deployment

**Risk 4: Java Comparison Overemphasis**

- **Risk**: Content becomes too Java-focused, alienating non-Java developers
- **Likelihood**: Medium (easy to over-compare given reference choice)
- **Impact**: Medium (reduces usefulness for broader audience)
- **Mitigation**: Strategic Java comparisons only (Best Practices, Anti-Patterns, specific sections), maintain Kotlin-first approach in tutorials

**Risk 5: Validation Agent Failures**

- **Risk**: Content doesn't pass one or more validation agents
- **Likelihood**: Low (with careful adherence to standards)
- **Impact**: Medium (requires rework, delays deployment)
- **Mitigation**: Run validation agents incrementally during development, fix issues early, study existing validated content (Java, Python, Golang)

**Risk 6: Pedagogical Flow Issues**

- **Risk**: Content doesn't flow well pedagogically, confuses learners
- **Likelihood**: Low (with adherence to Programming Language Content Standard)
- **Impact**: High (reduces learning effectiveness)
- **Mitigation**: Follow proven pedagogical patterns from benchmark languages, manual review for flow, progressive disclosure strictly enforced
