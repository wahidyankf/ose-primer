# Source-code credential scanning (evaluate Betterleaks)

One-line summary: catch hard-coded credentials in `.rs` / `.go` / `.ts` / `.tf` source **before** they
leave the developer's machine, rather than only after a push.

> Idea, added 2026-07-21 (original capture undated).

## Problem / context

Today the only credential-scanning coverage is GitHub Secret Scanning, which runs **post-push** — by
the time it fires, the secret has already left the machine and entered git history (permanent). GitHub
Secret Scanning brings 700+ partner patterns plus AI-backed generic detection, but there is no
pre-commit or CI gate that inspects source files for hard-coded credentials before they land.

## Why now

Betterleaks (an MIT-licensed gitleaks successor, v1.0.0 early 2026) is emerging as a maintained option
just as gitleaks itself has gone feature-frozen with an unresolved entropy false-positive regression
([#1830](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/issues/1830)) that misfires on Rust/Go identifier
names — so the incumbent tool is not a good fit for this repo's Rust-and-Go-heavy polyglot source.

## Proposed direction (sketch)

- Once Betterleaks reaches stable production use, evaluate it for pre-commit + CI credential detection
  across `.rs` / `.go` / `.ts` / `.tf` source.
- Wire it as a warning-grade gate alongside the existing cross-language linters, not a hard blocker at
  first.
- Keep GitHub Secret Scanning as the post-push backstop — the two are complementary, not exclusive.

## Rough scope & non-goals

In scope: pre-push detection of hard-coded credentials in committed source files.

Out of scope (for now): replacing GitHub Secret Scanning; `.env*` handling (already covered by the
env-file-access guardrails); secret rotation or remediation workflow.

## Risks & open questions

- False-positive rate on Rust/Go identifier names — the exact failure mode that makes gitleaks
  unsuitable. Does Betterleaks avoid it? (open — needs hands-on evaluation)
- Does Betterleaks actually reach stable, maintained production use, or stall like its predecessor?
  (open)
- The 60-day production-soak window (per the dependency-bump policy) has not yet elapsed.

## What success looks like + promotion signal

Success: a hard-coded credential in source is caught on the developer's machine, before it can enter
git history. This is a **time-gated** idea — ready to promote only once Betterleaks has 60+ days of
production soak and a stable release, and a quick evaluation confirms an acceptable false-positive rate
on this repo's Rust and Go source. Until then it correctly stays a two-pager.
