# Delivery Plan: Spec-Coverage Full Enforcement

## Delivery Overview

Work is organized into six phases: one prerequisite phase (tool + CI enforcement), one parser
recheck phase, plus four implementation phases matching the effort tiers. Each project is
independently deliverable.

**Per-project delivery template**:

1. Run `npx nx run <project>:spec-coverage` to confirm the current gap count (or note that the
   target is currently absent).
2. Create granular tasks (one per feature area within the project, e.g., "auth steps",
   "expenses steps", "admin steps") using TaskCreate. Mark each `in_progress` when starting
   and `completed` when done.
3. Implement missing step definitions using the language-specific developer agent. **No
   shortcuts**: every step must contain earnest implementation logic — no stubs, no `pending()`,
   no empty bodies, no `assert(true)`. Each step must exercise the actual service function and
   assert the expected outcome matching the reference implementation.
4. Run `npx nx run <project>:test:quick` to verify tests pass and coverage meets the threshold.
5. Add the `spec-coverage` target to `apps/<project>/project.json` using the command pattern
   from [tech-docs.md](./tech-docs.md#nx-target-command-patterns).
6. Run `npx nx run <project>:spec-coverage` to confirm 0 gaps.
7. Commit using conventional commit format:
   `feat(<project>): implement missing BDD step definitions and restore spec-coverage`.

## Phase 0: Tool Correctness + CI Enforcement

### 0.1 Fix rhino-cli Background step parsing

- [x] Fix `ParseFeatureFile` to include Background steps as a synthetic "(Background)" scenario
- [x] Add parser tests for Background step handling
- [x] Verify coverage ≥90% for rhino-cli

### 0.2 Enforce spec-coverage in CI

All pushes, PRs, and `Test*` workflows must reject when spec-coverage fails:

- [x] Add `spec-coverage` to `pr-quality-gate.yml` — all 9 language quality gate jobs
- [x] Add `spec-coverage` job to `_reusable-test-and-deploy.yml` (ayokoding-web, oseplatform-web)
- [x] Add `spec-coverage` job to `test-organiclever.yml`
- [x] Add `spec-coverage` job to `test-a-demo-be-golang-gin.yml`
- [x] Add `spec-coverage` job to `test-a-demo-be-fsharp-giraffe.yml`
- [x] Add `spec-coverage` job to `test-a-demo-be-csharp-aspnetcore.yml`
- [x] Add `spec-coverage` job to `test-a-demo-fs-ts-nextjs.yml`
- [x] Add `spec-coverage` job to `test-a-demo-fe-ts-nextjs.yml`
- [x] Add `spec-coverage` job to `test-a-demo-fe-ts-tanstack-start.yml`
- [ ] Add `spec-coverage` job to remaining `Test*` workflows as each project's target is restored
- [x] Pre-push hook already enforces `spec-coverage` (done in prior commit)

### 0.3 Update plan gap counts (Background steps now included)

Corrected totals after parser fix:

| Project                   | Old | New | Delta |
| ------------------------- | --- | --- | ----- |
| a-demo-be-rust-axum       | 58  | 59  | +1    |
| a-demo-be-java-vertx      | 79  | 80  | +1    |
| a-demo-be-kotlin-ktor     | 96  | 97  | +1    |
| a-demo-fe-dart-flutterweb | 220 | 241 | +21   |

### 0.4 Recheck parser correctness across ALL projects

Before implementing any step definitions, rerun `rhino-cli spec-coverage validate` on **every**
project in `apps/` and `libs/` that has a `spec-coverage` Nx target — not just the 11 failing
ones. This confirms the parser (after the Background step fix) reports correct coverage for the
19 already-passing projects and catches any newly introduced gaps.

- [x] Run `npx nx run-many -t spec-coverage` for all projects that currently have the target
      (the 19 passing projects). Record the output.
- [x] Verify every currently-passing project still reports 0 gaps.
- [x] If any previously-passing project now reports gaps (due to the Background step parser fix
      surfacing new steps), add those gaps to this plan as new work items.
- [x] Run spec-coverage manually (via the `go run` command from tech-docs.md) for each of the
      11 failing projects to confirm the exact gap count matches the plan. Record the actual
      missing step lists.
- [x] If any gap count differs from the plan, update the plan (README.md, requirements.md,
      delivery.md, tech-docs.md) with corrected counts before proceeding.

**Agent**: `swe-typescript-developer`
**Feature areas**: Health endpoint matching, JWKS endpoint

      step or update the step text to match the Gherkin exactly.
- [x] Add a step definition for `When the client sends GET /.well-known/jwks.json` that calls
      the JWKS service function.
- [x] Run `npx nx run a-demo-be-ts-effect:test:quick` and confirm exit 0 with coverage ≥ 90%.

      confirm whether one step definition covers all three or each needs a separate handler).

      that calls the token refresh service with the stored original token.
