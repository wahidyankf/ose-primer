# Technical Documentation: UI Development Improvement

## Architecture Decisions

### AD1: Impeccable-Inspired Skill vs. Direct Installation

**Decision**: Create a **repo-specific UI skill** inspired by impeccable.style rather than
installing impeccable directly.

**Trade-offs**:

| Factor | Install Impeccable Directly | Build Repo-Specific Skill (Chosen) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Setup effort | `npx skills add pbakaus/impeccable` (minutes) | Create SKILL.md + 5 reference modules (hours) |
| Token awareness | Generic — no knowledge of our tokens | References our actual `--color-primary`, `--radius`, etc. |
| Brand context | `.impeccable.md` at root (generic format) | Brand context embedded in skill (per-app specifics) |
| Anti-patterns | Universal anti-patterns (24 items) | Universal + repo-specific (hardcoded hex in code blocks, etc.) |
| Maintenance | Upstream updates automatically | We maintain it — more control, more work |
| Slash commands | 20 built-in commands | Build equivalent into agent workflows |
| Compatibility | Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, etc. | Claude Code + OpenCode only (our two systems) |
| Measured impact | 59% quality improvement (Tessl) | Unknown — no benchmark yet |

**Rationale**: The token-awareness and repo-specific anti-patterns are essential. Impeccable
teaches universal design principles but cannot know that our `--primary` is neutral gray in one
app and blue in another, or that `#f6f8fa` appears hardcoded in our code block CSS. The
incremental effort to build a repo-specific skill is justified by the precision it provides.

**What we take from impeccable**:

| Concept | How We Adapt It |
| --- | --- |
| 7 reference modules | Create 5 reference docs covering our specific tokens and patterns |
| Anti-pattern library | Document repo-specific anti-patterns with actual code from our codebase |
| Context file (`.impeccable.md`) | Include brand context directly in `reference/brand-context.md` |
| `/audit` workflow | Build into `swe-ui-checker` agent as validation dimensions |
| `/critique` UX review | Include UX heuristics in skill's component-patterns reference |
| Measured quality vocabulary | Adopt structured design terminology (rhythm, hierarchy, measure) |

**What we intentionally leave out**: `/animate`, `/colorize`, `/bolder`, `/quieter`, `/delight`,
`/overdrive` — these are creative steering commands more suited to greenfield design than our
convention-driven approach. We focus on consistency and quality, not creative exploration.

### AD2: Shared Library Strategy — Two Packages vs. One vs. None

**Decision**: Create two Nx libraries: `libs/ts-ui-tokens` and `libs/ts-ui`.

**Trade-offs**:

| Factor | No Shared Lib (Status Quo) | One Monolithic Lib | Two Separate Libs (Chosen) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Token-only consumers | N/A — each app owns tokens | Must import all of ts-ui for just tokens | Import ts-ui-tokens alone |
| Nx caching | N/A | One cache key for everything | Tokens cached separately from components |
| Change frequency | N/A | Token change invalidates component cache | Token change only invalidates token consumers |
| Flutter/TanStack compat | N/A | Cannot use React lib | Can use token CSS vars without React |
| Complexity | Zero | Low | Moderate — two libs to maintain |
| Dependency graph | Flat | One edge per consumer | Two edges per consumer (tokens + components) |
| shadcn/ui model | "Copy and own" per app | Centrally governed | Centrally governed tokens, shared components |

**Why not keep status quo**: Token drift is already happening (neutral vs. blue primary). Without
a shared source, every new app starts from zero and diverges further.

**Why not one lib**: `demo-fe-dart-flutterweb` and `demo-fe-ts-tanstack-start` need tokens but
cannot use React components. Forcing them to depend on React would be wrong.

**Token package structure**:

### AD3: Token Reconciliation Strategy — Structural vs. Brand

**Decision**: Share **structural tokens** (radius, spacing, typography scale, base gray palette)
across all apps. Allow **brand tokens** (primary, accent, chart colors, sidebar colors) to be
overridden per app.

**Trade-offs**:

| Factor | Share Everything | Share Structure Only (Chosen) | Share Nothing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Consistency | Maximum — all apps look identical | Structural consistency, brand freedom | Zero consistency |
| Brand identity | Apps lose unique identity | Apps keep unique brand colors | Full brand freedom |
| Token count shared | ~25 tokens | ~10 structural tokens | 0 tokens |
| Override complexity | No overrides needed | Per-app color overrides in globals.css | N/A |
| Maintenance | One file for all tokens | One shared + per-app overrides | Per-app everything |

**Rationale**: organiclever-web is a business productivity app (neutral, professional).
ayokoding-web is an educational platform (blue, approachable). Forcing identical brand colors
would harm both products. But radius, spacing rhythm, and typography scale should be consistent
for shared component compatibility.

**Concrete token split**:

Shared (in `ts-ui-tokens/src/tokens.css`):

- `--radius`: `0.5rem` (base) with computed `--radius-md`, `--radius-sm`
- Spacing scale: 4pt system (`--space-1` through `--space-16`)
- Typography scale: `--text-xs` through `--text-4xl`
- Base neutrals: `--background`, `--foreground`, `--border`, `--input`, `--ring` (gray palette)
- Semantic: `--muted`, `--muted-foreground`, `--destructive`, `--destructive-foreground`

Per-app override (in app's `globals.css`):

- `--primary`, `--primary-foreground`
- `--secondary`, `--secondary-foreground`
- `--accent`, `--accent-foreground`
- `--chart-1` through `--chart-5` (organiclever-web only)
- `--sidebar-*` (ayokoding-web only)

### AD4: Convention Documentation Location

**Decision**: Create `governance/development/frontend/` directory with four focused documents.

**Trade-offs**:

| Factor | One Big File | Four Focused Files (Chosen) | Inline in CLAUDE.md |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Discoverability | One place to look | Must check index | Already loaded in context |
| Context window | Large single load | Load only what's needed | Always in context (bloat) |
| Maintenance | Merge conflicts | Independent editing | CLAUDE.md already large |
| Agent access | One read call | Multiple reads, or skill reference | Automatic |
| Reusability | Hard to reference specific section | Link to specific file | Cannot link subsections |

**Files and their scope**:

| File | Content | Approx. Lines |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `design-tokens.md` | Token categories, naming convention, the structural-vs-brand split, per-app override pattern, dark mode token requirements, when to create new tokens vs. reuse | 80-120 |
| `component-patterns.md` | CVA variant definitions, Radix primitive composition, cn() utility usage, slot/asChild pattern, React.ComponentProps pattern (not forwardRef), data-slot attributes, required state coverage list, component file structure | 100-150 |
| `accessibility.md` | WCAG AA compliance rules, focus-visible (not focus) requirement, reduced-motion support, aria attributes by component type, label requirements, color-contrast rules (APCA preferred), minimum hit targets (24px desktop, 44px mobile), form input requirements | 80-120 |
| `styling.md` | Tailwind v4 conventions (@theme, @layer, @custom-variant), utility-first approach (no @apply except in @layer base), class ordering via prettier-plugin-tailwindcss, no inline styles in production apps, no !important, defensive CSS patterns, container queries over breakpoints, mobile-first | 80-120 |

### AD5: UI Skill Architecture

**Decision**: Create a single skill `swe-developing-frontend-ui` with reference modules.

**Trade-offs**:

| Factor | Single Skill (Chosen) | Multiple Skills (one per domain) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Context loading | One skill, selective reference reads | Multiple skills may all trigger |
| Maintenance | One SKILL.md to update | 5+ SKILL.md files |
| Coherence | Cross-cutting concerns in one place | Fragmented knowledge |
| Size | Larger SKILL.md (~200 lines) | Smaller individual files |
| Trigger precision | Broader match (any TSX/CSS) | Could scope per domain |

**SKILL.md frontmatter**:

```yaml
---
name: swe-developing-frontend-ui
description: UI development skill covering design token usage, shadcn/ui + Radix composition
  patterns, accessibility requirements, anti-patterns catalog, and brand context for
  OrganicLever and OSE Platform. Auto-loads when working on TSX components, CSS, or UI
  design tasks.
---
```

Note: Skills in this repository use only `name` and `description` in frontmatter. Auto-trigger
behavior is achieved via the description content matching the task context — not via `filePattern`
or `bashPattern` fields.

**Anti-pattern catalog** (repo-specific, with code examples):

| Anti-Pattern | Example From Our Codebase | Correct Approach |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hardcoded hex in CSS | `background-color: #f6f8fa !important;` (ayokoding-web globals.css) | Use token: `bg-muted` or `var(--color-muted)` |
| `!important` in Tailwind | `color: #24292e !important;` (ayokoding-web globals.css, 10 occurrences) | Use `@layer` specificity or Tailwind modifiers |
| Font via `@layer utilities` | `font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;` (organiclever-web) | Use `next/font` for optimization |
| Old Radix imports | `import { Slot } from "@radix-ui/react-slot"` | `import { Slot } from "radix-ui"` |
| forwardRef pattern | `React.forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, Props>` | `function Button(props: React.ComponentProps<"button">)` |
| Missing data-slot | `<button className={...}>` | `<button data-slot="button" className={...}>` |
| Inline styles in production | `style={{ color: 'red' }}` | Use Tailwind utility: `className="text-destructive"` |
| Card inside Card | `<Card><Card>nested</Card></Card>` | Use spacing/dividers for hierarchy |
| Color-only status | `<span className="text-red-500">Error</span>` | Include text label + shape per [Accessibility First](../../governance/principles/content/accessibility-first.md) |
| Non-accessible palette color | `className="text-red-500"` or `bg-green-500` | Use accessible palette or semantic tokens per [Color Accessibility Convention](../../governance/conventions/formatting/color-accessibility.md) |
| Missing focus-visible | `focus:ring-2` | `focus-visible:ring-2` (keyboard users only) |
| `transition: all` | `className="transition-all"` | `className="transition-colors"` (explicit properties) |
| bounce/elastic easing | `animate-bounce` | `animate-ease-out` or custom exponential easing |

### AD6: Agent Strategy — Checker Only vs. Full Trio

**Decision**: Create only `swe-ui-checker` in Phase 1. Defer maker and fixer to later phases.

**Trade-offs**:

| Factor | Checker Only (Chosen) | Full Trio (checker + maker + fixer) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Effort | 1 agent definition | 3 agent definitions + coordination |
| Value | Identifies violations | Identifies AND fixes violations |
| Risk | Low — read-only analysis | Higher — fixer may introduce regressions |
| Dependency | Only needs conventions + skill | Fixer needs deep component knowledge |
| Precedent | Matches other checker-first rollouts in repo | No precedent for UI fixer |

**Rationale**: The checker provides the most diagnostic value with the least risk. A fixer that
modifies component TSX is high-risk — it could break visual appearance, accessibility, or
functionality. Better to validate conventions are stable before automating fixes.

**swe-ui-checker dimensions with severity**:

| Dimension | Checks | Severity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Token compliance | Hardcoded hex/rgb/hsl in className, style props, CSS | HIGH — drift source |
| Accessibility | aria-*, role, focus-visible, labels, reduced-motion | HIGH — legal/compliance |
| Component patterns | CVA usage, cn() calls, Radix primitives, data-slot | MEDIUM — consistency |
| Dark mode | All visual tokens have dark variants, no light-only colors | MEDIUM — user experience |
| Responsive | Container queries, mobile-first, no desktop-only features | LOW — depends on app |
| Anti-patterns | All items from anti-pattern catalog | Varies by pattern |

### AD7: Testing Strategy — Where to Put What

**Decision**: Layer UI quality checks into the existing three-level test pipeline.

**Trade-offs**:

| Test Type | In Unit Tests | In Integration Tests | In E2E Tests |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| axe-core a11y | Fast, component-level (Chosen) | Slower, needs browser | Slowest, full page |
| Visual regression | No browser, cannot screenshot | Can screenshot components | Full page screenshots (Chosen for pages) |
| Component interaction | JSDOM limitations | Real browser | Real browser + real backend |
| Execution speed | Milliseconds | Seconds | Seconds to minutes |
| CI cost | Low | Medium | High |

**Chosen allocation**:

| Level | UI Addition | Tool | What It Catches | Responsive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Unit (`test:unit`) | axe-core a11y assertions | vitest-axe | Missing aria, roles, labels, contrast | N/A (JSDOM) |
| Integration (`test:integration`) | Component visual snapshots | Playwright `toHaveScreenshot()` | Unintended visual changes to individual components | 3 viewports per component |
| E2E (`test:e2e`) | Full-page visual regression | Playwright `toHaveScreenshot()` | Layout breaks, theme issues across full pages | 3 viewports per page |

**axe-core integration pattern** (using setup file for global extension):

```typescript
// libs/ts-ui/vitest.setup.ts
import 'vitest-axe/extend-expect';
```

```typescript
// libs/ts-ui/vitest.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    setupFiles: ['./vitest.setup.ts'],
  },
});
```

```typescript
// libs/ts-ui/src/components/button/button.test.tsx
import { axe } from 'vitest-axe';
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import { Button } from './button';

test('Button is accessible', async () => {
  const { container } = render(<Button>Click me</Button>);
  const results = await axe(container);
  expect(results).toHaveNoViolations();
});

test('Icon-only Button requires aria-label', async () => {
  const { container } = render(<Button size="icon" aria-label="Close"><XIcon /></Button>);
  const results = await axe(container);
  expect(results).toHaveNoViolations();
});
```

Alternatively, use the inline import pattern: `import { toHaveNoViolations } from 'vitest-axe/matchers'`
and `expect.extend({ toHaveNoViolations })` per test file.

### AD8: Linting Rules — Targeted vs. Comprehensive

**Decision**: Add targeted ESLint rules, not a full custom plugin.

**Trade-offs**:

| Factor | jsx-a11y Only | jsx-a11y + Custom Token Rule (Chosen) | Full Custom Plugin |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Effort | Install + configure | Install + write one custom rule | Build plugin package |
| Coverage | A11y only | A11y + token enforcement | A11y + tokens + patterns |
| Maintenance | Zero (community-maintained) | One rule to maintain | Full plugin lifecycle |
| False positives | Low (mature plugin) | Medium (regex-based detection) | Low (AST-based) |
| Adoption friction | Low | Low-medium | High |

**Why not Stylelint**: Our apps use Tailwind utility classes in TSX, not traditional CSS. The
only significant CSS file is `globals.css`, which is managed by the token system. The primary
enforcement point is in TSX files via ESLint. Adding Stylelint would mean a new tool in the
pipeline for minimal coverage.

**Custom token rule approach**: A regex-based ESLint rule that flags:

- `className="..."` containing `#[0-9a-fA-F]{3,8}` (hex colors in Tailwind arbitrary values)
- `style={{ ... }}` containing hex/rgb/hsl color values
- `className="..."` containing `text-\[#`, `bg-\[#`, `border-\[#` patterns

This is simpler than an AST-based approach and catches the most common violations. False
positives (e.g., hex in SVG data URIs) can be suppressed with eslint-disable comments.

### AD9: Class Ordering with Prettier

**Decision**: Add `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` to the existing Prettier setup.

**Trade-offs**:

| Factor | No Class Ordering (Status Quo) | Prettier Plugin (Chosen) | ESLint Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Enforcement | None | Automatic on save + pre-commit | Manual fix required |
| Developer friction | Zero | Zero (automatic) | Must run fix command |
| Integration | N/A | Prettier already in pre-commit | ESLint already in pre-push |
| Diff noise | Inconsistent ordering across PRs | One-time reformat, then stable | Same as Prettier |
| Multi-app config | N/A | Need `tailwindStylesheet` per app | Need config per app |

**Configuration challenge**: The repo has multiple apps with different `globals.css` files.
`prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` accepts a single `tailwindStylesheet` path. Options:

1. **Single stylesheet** (simplest): Point to one app's `globals.css`. Other apps' classes still
   sort correctly because the plugin only needs to know the Tailwind configuration, not the exact
   token values. Token names are the same across apps.
2. **Per-app override** (precise): Use Prettier's `overrides` config to set different
   `tailwindStylesheet` per app directory.

**Chosen**: Option 1 (single stylesheet) initially, with option 2 if sorting issues arise.

**Configuration** (`.prettierrc.json`):

```json
{
  "printWidth": 120,
  "proseWrap": "preserve",
  "plugins": ["prettier-plugin-tailwindcss"],
  "tailwindStylesheet": "./apps/organiclever-web/src/app/globals.css"
}
```

### AD10: Storybook Scope — Library vs. Per-App

**Decision**: Configure Storybook in `libs/ts-ui/` (shared component library), not per-app.

**Trade-offs**:

| Factor | Per-App Storybook | Shared Lib Storybook (Chosen) | Both |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| What it documents | App-specific components + shared | Shared components only | Everything |
| Maintenance | N Storybook configs | 1 Storybook config | N+1 configs |
| Version conflicts | Each app pins own version | One version | Must align all |
| Build time | Slower (per-app builds) | Fast (one lib) | Slowest |
| Coverage | App-specific patterns visible | Only shared components | Full coverage |

**Rationale**: organiclever-web already has Storybook. Rather than maintaining two (or more)
Storybook instances, consolidate into the shared lib. App-specific components that need
documentation can be added to the shared Storybook via composition or documented in the app's
README.

**organiclever-web's existing Storybook**: Will be migrated to `libs/ts-ui/.storybook/` as
shared components are extracted. The app-level `.storybook/` can be removed once all stories
are moved.

## Technology Choices

| Need | Choice | Rationale | Alternatives Considered |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Class ordering | prettier-plugin-tailwindcss | Prettier already in pre-commit | eslint-plugin-tailwindcss (manual fix) |
| A11y unit tests | vitest-axe | Vitest already used in all TS apps | jest-axe (Jest, not our runner) |
| A11y lint | eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y | ESLint already configured | axe-linter (VS Code only) |
| Visual regression | Playwright toHaveScreenshot() | Playwright already in E2E tests | Chromatic (SaaS, cost), Percy (SaaS, cost) |
| Component catalog | Storybook 10 | Already in organiclever-web | Ladle (less mature), React Cosmos (niche) |
| Component variants | CVA (already in use) | Type-safe, composable | Tailwind Variants (similar, less adopted) |
| Class utilities | cn() via clsx + tailwind-merge | Already the pattern | Only clsx (no merge), only tw-merge (no conditional) |
| Design tokens | CSS custom properties + Tailwind @theme | Already the pattern | Style Dictionary (overkill), Tokens Studio (Figma-dependent) |

## Migration Path — Detailed

### For organiclever-web

1. **Token extraction**: Copy structural token definitions from `globals.css` to
   `libs/ts-ui-tokens/src/tokens.css`. Keep brand-specific overrides (`--primary: 0 0% 9%`)
   in the app's `globals.css`.
2. **Import shared tokens**: Replace `@theme { ... }` block with
   `@import "@open-sharia-enterprise/ts-ui-tokens/tokens.css"` plus app-specific `@theme`
   overrides.
3. **Fix existing violations**: Replace `font-family: Arial` with `next/font` import. Remove
   the `@layer utilities { body { font-family: ... } }` block.
4. **Component extraction**: Move the 4 shared components (Alert, Button, Dialog, Input) to
   `libs/ts-ui/`. Update to use `radix-ui` unified import and `React.ComponentProps` pattern.
   Keep AlertDialog, Card, Label, Table as app-specific until other apps need them.
5. **Update imports**: Replace `@/components/ui/button` with
   `@open-sharia-enterprise/ts-ui/button` throughout the app.
6. **Remove duplicated code**: Delete `src/components/ui/button.tsx` (now in shared lib). Delete
   `src/lib/utils.ts` cn() function (now in shared lib).
7. **Migrate Storybook stories**: Move component stories to `libs/ts-ui/`. Update
   `.storybook/main.ts` to reference shared lib.
8. **Verify**: Run `nx run organiclever-web:test:quick` and `nx storybook ts-ui`.

### For ayokoding-web

1. **Token extraction**: Same as organiclever-web for structural tokens. Keep blue brand
   overrides (`--primary: 221.2 83.2% 53.3%`) and sidebar tokens in app's `globals.css`.
2. **Fix existing violations**: Replace 6 hardcoded hex colors in code block CSS with token
   references or CSS variables. Replace `!important` declarations with `@layer` specificity
   management.
3. **Import shared tokens**: Same pattern as organiclever-web.
4. **Component extraction**: Move shared components (Alert, Button, Dialog, Input) to shared
   lib. Keep content-specific components (Breadcrumb, Footer, Header, LanguageSwitcher,
   MobileNav, Sidebar, SidebarTree, ThemeToggle, TOC) as app-specific.
5. **Update imports**: Replace `src/components/ui/button` with shared lib import.
6. **Keep typography plugin**: `@plugin "@tailwindcss/typography"` stays in app's `globals.css`
   since it's content-specific.
7. **Verify**: Run `nx run ayokoding-web:test:quick`.

### For demo-fe-ts-nextjs

1. **Add Tailwind v4**: Install `@tailwindcss/postcss` and `@tailwindcss/vite`. Create
   `globals.css` importing shared tokens.
2. **Replace inline styles**: Convert `src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx`,
   `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`, `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` from inline styles
   to Tailwind utility classes.
3. **Replace `useBreakpoint()` hook**: Use Tailwind responsive prefixes (`md:`, `lg:`) instead
   of JavaScript breakpoint detection.
4. **Import shared components**: Use Button, Card, etc. from `@open-sharia-enterprise/ts-ui`
   where appropriate.
5. **Verify**: Run `nx run demo-fe-ts-nextjs:test:quick`.

### For demo-fs-ts-nextjs

1. Same approach as demo-fe-ts-nextjs (minimal styling, add tokens + shared components).

### For demo-fe-dart-flutterweb (limited scope)

1. **Token consumption only**: Generate a `tokens.dart` file from `ts-ui-tokens/src/tokens.css`
   (manual or script). Flutter cannot consume CSS vars directly.
2. **No component sharing**: Flutter uses Material 3 — React components are not applicable.
3. **Structural alignment**: Use same radius, spacing scale values in `ThemeData`.

## Governance Alignment

Every architecture decision in this plan traces to one or more governance principles:

| AD | Primary Principle | How It Aligns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AD1 (Repo-specific skill) | Explicit Over Implicit | Skill references our actual tokens explicitly, not generic guidance |
| AD2 (Two packages) | Simplicity Over Complexity | Each lib has one clear purpose; no monolithic abstraction |
| AD3 (Structural vs. brand) | Accessibility First | Shared tokens enforce consistent contrast ratios and dark mode |
| AD4 (Convention docs) | Documentation First | Conventions documented before code exists |
| AD5 (Single skill) | Simplicity Over Complexity | One skill over fragmented five; minimum viable approach |
| AD6 (Checker only) | Root Cause Orientation | Diagnose first (checker), fix later; surgical approach |
| AD7 (Testing layers) | Three-Level Testing Standard | axe-core maps to unit, visual regression to integration/E2E |
| AD8 (Targeted lint) | Automation Over Manual | Automated enforcement in CI; developer does not need to remember rules |
| AD9 (Prettier plugin) | Automation Over Manual | Class ordering happens automatically on save; zero friction |
| AD10 (Shared Storybook) | Progressive Disclosure | Stories layer from default → variants → advanced patterns |

### Color Accessibility Compliance

The [Color Accessibility Convention](../../governance/conventions/formatting/color-accessibility.md)
and [Accessibility First](../../governance/principles/content/accessibility-first.md) principle
require:

- **Semantic color tokens** (`--color-destructive`, `--color-primary`) must produce WCAG AA
  contrast ratios in both light and dark modes
- **Chart and status colors** must come from the mandatory accessible 5-color palette
  (#0173B2, #DE8F05, #029E73, #CC78BC, #CA9161)
- **Never rely on color alone** — status indicators must include text labels and/or shapes
- **Anti-pattern catalog** includes color-only status and non-accessible palette violations

These requirements are enforced through:

1. **Conventions** (Phase 1): `accessibility.md` references the palette and contrast rules
2. **Skill** (Phase 1): Anti-pattern catalog flags color-only and non-accessible colors
3. **Agent** (Phase 1): `swe-ui-checker` validates token contrast and color usage
4. **Lint** (Phase 3): `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` catches missing labels and aria attributes
5. **Tests** (Phase 3): `vitest-axe` catches contrast and semantic violations at unit test time
