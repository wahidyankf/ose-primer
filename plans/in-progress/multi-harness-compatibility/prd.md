# Product Requirements — Multi-Harness Compatibility

## Product Overview

Deliver the artifacts that make `ose-primer` harness-agnostic in governance and compatible with nine
named coding-agent harnesses: a hardened vendor-audit (in both CLI implementations), a two-tier set of
platform bindings, a research-backed compatibility-audit workflow, supporting rhino CLI changes held
byte-identical across Rust and Go, updated specs, and propagated governance rules.

## Personas

- **Maya, the maintainer.** Runs governance audits and owns the binding catalog. Wants mechanical
  enforcement and a repeatable way to catch upstream config drift without manually reading nine docs
  sites — and wants the Rust and Go CLIs to stay provably identical so she only reasons about behavior
  once.
- **Devi, the multi-tool contributor.** Switches between Cursor at work and Codex CLI at home. Wants the
  same project instructions to apply automatically in both, with no per-tool copy-paste.
- **Tariq, the template adopter.** Forks `ose-primer` and uses Amazon Q. Wants the scaffolding to already
  account for a harness that does not read `AGENTS.md`, so his harness is not a second-class citizen the
  moment he clones the template.

## User Stories

1. As Maya, I want governance prose to fail the audit if it names any of the nine vendors outside an
   allowlisted region, so the governance layer stays neutral.
2. As Maya, I want a workflow that re-verifies each harness's current config conventions against our
   catalog, so I learn about drift as a tracked finding instead of a contributor bug report.
3. As Devi, I want every harness I use to pick up the repo's canonical instructions automatically, so I do
   not maintain per-tool instruction copies.
4. As Tariq, I want Amazon Q (which does not read `AGENTS.md`) to still receive the repo's instructions via
   a committed bridge file, so my harness is not a second-class citizen.
5. As Maya, I want every new rhino CLI behavior covered by a Gherkin spec under `specs/apps/rhino/`, so the
   spec-coverage gate stays green and behavior is documented.
6. As Maya, I want a deterministic pre-push check (a `rhino-cli` command, not an agent) that fails when a
   committed binding file drifts from `AGENTS.md` or the catalog, so parity is enforced on every push
   without relying on a slow or non-deterministic agent.
7. As Maya, I want every related Markdown file (catalog, agent roster, workflow/convention indexes,
   `AGENTS.md` binding lists) updated in one sweep, so no doc references a stale binding/vendor/agent set.
8. As Maya, I want every rhino behavior I add (vendor-audit terms, binding emitter, binding-parity guard)
   to exist identically in both `rhino-cli-rust` and `rhino-cli-go`, so the shadow-diff parity gate stays
   green and neither implementation becomes the odd one out.

## Product Scope

**In:**

- Catalog and binding files for all nine harnesses + OpenCode (plus the reserved Aider row).
- Vendor-audit vocabulary extension with false-positive-safe patterns, in both CLI implementations.
- `repo-harness-compatibility-quality-gate` workflow + its checker/fixer agents.
- A new `agents emit-bindings` command and a deterministic `agents validate-bindings` command, each
  implemented in both CLIs, byte-identical, and added to the shadow-diff corpus.
- A deterministic, agent-free binding-parity guard wired into `.husky/pre-push`.
- `specs/apps/rhino/` features for the new behaviors.
- A closing sweep updating all related Markdown files (catalog, agent roster, indexes, `AGENTS.md` lists).
- Governance-rule propagation via `repo-rules-maker` and validation via `repo-rules-quality-gate`.

**Out:**

- Rewriting canonical `AGENTS.md` content.
- Global/per-user harness config.
- Harness feature parity (skills/subagents) beyond instruction compatibility.

## Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)

### AC1 — Governance prose stays vendor-neutral for all nine harnesses

```gherkin
Given the vendor-audit vocabulary has been extended for the nine harnesses in both CLI implementations
When a contributor writes "Junie" or "Antigravity" or "Amazon Q" in load-bearing prose under repo-governance/
And runs "rhino-cli repo-governance vendor-audit repo-governance/"
Then the audit exits non-zero
And the finding names the offending file, line, and a vendor-neutral replacement suggestion
```

### AC2 — Allowlisted regions and ambiguous tokens do not produce false positives

```gherkin
Given the vendor-audit covers the nine harnesses
When governance prose contains the mathematical constant "pi" in ordinary text
Or contains a vendor name inside a "Platform Binding Examples" heading section or a binding-example fence
Then the audit does not report those occurrences as violations
```

### AC3 — Every harness has a verified catalog entry

```gherkin
Given the platform-bindings catalog has been updated
When I open docs/reference/platform-bindings.md
Then each of the nine named harnesses plus OpenCode has a row
And each row records its root instruction file, whether it reads AGENTS.md natively, and its binding status
```

### AC4 — Amazon Q receives instructions via a committed bridge

```gherkin
Given Amazon Q Developer does not read AGENTS.md natively
When the Amazon Q binding is generated by "rhino-cli agents emit-bindings"
Then a committed file under .amazonq/ references the repository's canonical instructions
And the binding does not duplicate AGENTS.md content verbatim in a way that can drift
```

### AC5 — No tool-specific file silently shadows AGENTS.md

```gherkin
Given some harnesses rank a tool-specific file above AGENTS.md (GEMINI.md, .junie/AGENTS.md, AGENTS.override.md)
When the bindings are created
Then the repository does not introduce any such higher-precedence file that overrides AGENTS.md with different content
And the no-shadowing rule is documented in the multi-harness binding convention
```

### AC6 — Compatibility-audit workflow detects drift using web research

```gherkin
Given the repo-harness-compatibility-quality-gate workflow exists
When the workflow runs
Then it delegates to web-research-maker to fetch each supported harness's current config conventions
And it diffs those findings against docs/reference/platform-bindings.md and the committed binding files
And it writes a drift audit report to generated-reports/ citing the web sources used
```

### AC7 — rhino CLI changes are spec-covered in both implementations

```gherkin
Given rhino CLI vendor-audit and binding-emitter behavior changed
When the spec-coverage gate runs for rhino-cli-rust and rhino-cli-go
Then every new or changed behavior has a corresponding Gherkin feature under specs/apps/rhino/
And "nx run rhino-cli-rust:test:quick" and "nx run rhino-cli-go:test:quick" pass
And the spec-coverage target passes for both projects
```

### AC8 — Governance rules propagated and validated

```gherkin
Given the governance rules for multi-harness binding have been authored
When repo-rules-maker has propagated them and repo-rules-quality-gate has run in strict mode
Then the quality gate reaches two consecutive zero-finding validations on the changed governance files
```

### AC9 — Deterministic pre-push parity guard catches internal binding drift

```gherkin
Given the generated binding files are committed and a deterministic rhino-cli parity guard is wired into pre-push
When a committed binding file is edited so it no longer matches a regenerate from AGENTS.md
Or a binding directory exists on disk without a row in the platform-bindings catalog
And the pre-push hook runs
Then the deterministic guard exits non-zero and blocks the push
And the guard uses no AI agent and makes no network calls
```

### AC10 — All related Markdown files are updated

```gherkin
Given the binding catalog, vendor vocabulary, agent roster, and workflow index changed
When the closing documentation sweep runs
Then a grep for the old binding/vendor/agent state across tracked .md files returns no stale references
And "npm run lint:md" exits 0
```

### AC11 — Go and Rust implementations stay byte-identical

```gherkin
Given the vendor-audit extension, the agents emit-bindings command, and the agents validate-bindings command
  are implemented in both rhino-cli-go and rhino-cli-rust
When "bash apps/rhino-cli-rust/scripts/shadow-diff.sh agents repo-governance" runs
Then every corpus case produces byte-identical stdout, stderr, and exit code between the two binaries
And the CI "parity" job passes
```

## Product Risks

- **Spec-coverage friction.** New rhino CLI behavior without matching specs would fail the gate; mitigated
  by pairing every behavior change with a feature file in the same delivery phase.
- **Workflow naming conformance.** The new workflow must match the `-(quality-gate|execution|setup)` suffix
  rule; mitigated by naming it `repo-harness-compatibility-quality-gate`. [Repo-grounded —
  `repo-governance/conventions/structure/workflow-naming.md`]
- **Agent proliferation.** Two new agents are added; mitigated by reusing the established
  maker-checker-fixer pattern and keeping them narrowly scoped to compatibility auditing.
- **Byte-parity divergence.** A new command implemented in Rust but not Go (or with formatting drift)
  fails the shadow-diff gate; mitigated by sharing a single expected-binding derivation per implementation
  and adding shadow-diff corpus cases in the same phase as the implementation.
