## Platform Binding Examples

This file is the Claude Code platform-binding shim. The single-line `@AGENTS.md` directive above imports the canonical, vendor-neutral instruction surface. The rest of this file documents Claude-Code-specific binding details and is intentionally vendor-specific. Per the
[Governance Vendor Independence Convention](./governance/conventions/structure/governance-vendor-independence.md),
the vendor-audit scanner skips every line under this heading until the next same-level heading or end of file.

### Markdown Quality (Claude Code hook)

In addition to the standard Prettier + markdownlint pipeline, a Claude Code hook auto-formats and lints after Edit/Write operations (requires `jq`).

### Worktree Path (Claude Code binding)

Worktrees provisioned via `claude --worktree <name>` land at `.claude/worktrees/<name>/` per the [Worktree Path Convention](./governance/conventions/structure/worktree-path.md). The path is gitignored and parallel-safe.

### Development environment setup (Claude Code binding)

For first-time setup or after entering a fresh worktree, follow [Infra: Development Environment Setup](./governance/workflows/infra/infra-development-environment-setup.md). Set `OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY` in `.env` before starting an OpenCode session that depends on the secondary binding (template in `.env.example`).

### Working with `.claude/` and `.opencode/` directories

Edit `.claude/` and `.opencode/` files with normal `Write` / `Edit` tools. Both paths pre-authorized in `.claude/settings.json` (`Write(.claude/**)`, `Edit(.claude/**)`, `Write(.opencode/**)`, `Edit(.opencode/**)`), no approval prompt fires. `Bash` heredoc and `sed` remain fine for bulk mechanical substitutions, but no rule against direct edits.

**Applies to all paths**:

- `.claude/agents/*.md` — agent definition files (Claude Code format)
- `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` — agent skill files (source of truth for both Claude Code AND OpenCode; OpenCode reads natively per [opencode.ai/docs/skills](https://opencode.ai/docs/skills/), no mirror)
- `.claude/skills/*/reference/*.md` — skill reference modules
- `.opencode/agents/*.md` — OpenCode agent mirrors (auto-synced from `.claude/agents/`)

**See**: [primary binding agent catalog](./.claude/agents/README.md)

### Dual-mode configuration (Claude Code + OpenCode)

Repo maintains **dual compatibility** with Claude Code and OpenCode:

- **`.claude/`**: Source of truth (PRIMARY) — All updates happen here first
- **`.opencode/`**: Auto-generated (SECONDARY) — Synced from `.claude/`

**Making changes:**

1. Edit agents/skills in `.claude/` first
2. Run sync: `npm run sync:claude-to-opencode`
3. Both systems stay synced automatically

**Format differences:**

- **Tools**: Claude Code uses arrays `[Read, Write]`, OpenCode uses boolean flags `{ read: true, write: true }`
- **Models**: Claude Code uses `sonnet`/`opus`/`haiku` (or omits for budget-adaptive opus-inherit — intentional, not legacy); OpenCode uses `opencode-go/minimax-m2.7` (opus/sonnet/omitted) and `opencode-go/glm-5` (haiku). See [model-selection.md](./governance/development/agents/model-selection.md) for full capability-tier mapping.
- **Skills**: NOT mirrored — OpenCode reads `.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` natively per [opencode.ai/docs/skills](https://opencode.ai/docs/skills/). The validate:sync `No Synced Skill Mirror` check fails if a stale `.opencode/skill/` or `.opencode/skills/<claude-name>` mirror reappears.
- **Permissions**: Claude Code uses `settings.json` permissions, OpenCode uses `opencode.json` permission block (both configured with equivalent access)
- **MCP/Plugins**: Claude Code uses plugins, OpenCode uses MCP servers (Playwright, Nx, Perplexity)

**Security policy**: Only use skills from trusted sources. All skills in this repo maintained by project team.

### Nx-related notes (Claude-Code binding)

The Nx tooling guidelines, generator usage, and `nx_docs` policy are documented in [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) and apply identically here. The `<!-- nx configuration -->` markers above are preserved so the Nx auto-injection tool can refresh content if needed.
