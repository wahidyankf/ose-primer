# OSE Platform Web

Official website for the **Open Sharia Enterprise** platform - an open-source Sharia-compliant enterprise solutions platform built in the open.

**Why This Matters**: Islamic finance is a multi-trillion dollar industry, but most Sharia-compliant enterprise solutions are proprietary and expensive. We're building an open-source alternative with Sharia-compliance at its core - not bolted on as an afterthought.

**What This Site Does**: Showcases the platform and shares our journey. Weekly and monthly updates keep the community informed as we build this long-term project with radical transparency.

**Why Open Source**: Transparency builds trust in Sharia-compliant systems. By building in the open, we make trustworthy enterprise technology accessible to organizations of all sizes - not just those who can afford expensive proprietary solutions.

## 🚢 Deployment

**Production Branch**: `prod-oseplatform-web`

### Automated Deployment (Primary)

Deployment is automated via the `test-and-deploy-oseplatform-web.yml` GitHub Actions workflow:

- **Schedule**: Runs at **6 AM and 6 PM WIB** (UTC+7) every day
- **Change detection**: Compares `HEAD` on `main` against `prod-oseplatform-web`, scoped to `apps/oseplatform-web/`. Skips build and deploy if nothing changed
- **Build**: Runs `nx build oseplatform-web` (Hugo extended build with PaperMod theme)
- **Deploy**: Force-pushes `main` to `prod-oseplatform-web`; Vercel detects the push and builds automatically

**Manual trigger**: The workflow can also be triggered on-demand from the GitHub Actions UI. Set `force_deploy=true` to deploy even if no changes are detected.

### Emergency / On-Demand Deployment

For immediate deployments outside the scheduled window, use the `apps-oseplatform-web-deployer` AI agent or run directly:

```bash
git push --force origin HEAD:prod-oseplatform-web
```
