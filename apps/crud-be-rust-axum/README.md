# crud-be-rust-axum

Rust + Axum REST API backend — a functional twin of `crud-be-golang-gin` (Go/Gin),
`crud-be-elixir-phoenix` (Elixir/Phoenix), and other demo-be backends using Rust and the Axum framework.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Rust (stable toolchain)
- SQLite (bundled via sqlx)
- Docker (for integration tests with PostgreSQL)

### Environment Variables

| Variable       | Default           | Description         |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| `PORT`         | `8201`            | HTTP port           |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `sqlite::memory:` | Database connection |
| `JWT_SECRET`   | (dev default)     | JWT signing secret  |

### Run locally

```bash
# Run dev server (SQLite in-memory)
cargo run

# Health check
curl http://localhost:8201/health
```

## Nx Targets

```bash
nx build crud-be-rust-axum                    # Compile release binary (depends on codegen)
nx dev crud-be-rust-axum                      # Start development server
nx run crud-be-rust-axum:typecheck            # cargo check (depends on codegen)
nx run crud-be-rust-axum:test:quick           # Unit tests + coverage gate (no lint; depends on codegen)
nx run crud-be-rust-axum:test:unit            # Unit tests only (lib + BDD with SQLite in-memory; depends on codegen)
nx run crud-be-rust-axum:test:integration     # Integration tests via Docker Compose (PostgreSQL)
nx lint crud-be-rust-axum                     # Run clippy + rustfmt check
```

`codegen` generates Rust model structs from the OpenAPI contract spec into `generated-contracts/`
and is a dependency of `typecheck`, `build`, `test:quick`, and `test:unit`.

## API Endpoints

See the [OpenAPI contract](../../specs/apps/crud/contracts/README.md) for the full API surface.

## Test Architecture

This project uses a three-level test architecture:

### Unit Tests (`tests/unit/`)

- Run all shared Gherkin scenarios using cucumber-rs with Tower TestClient
- Use SQLite in-memory database (no external services required)
- Also include inline `#[cfg(test)]` unit tests in source modules
- Run via `cargo test --lib --test unit`
- Coverage measured with cargo-llvm-cov and validated at ≥90%
- Used by `test:quick` and `test:unit` targets

### Integration Tests (`tests/integration/`)

- Run all shared Gherkin scenarios against a real PostgreSQL 17 database
- Launched via Docker Compose (`docker-compose.integration.yml`)
- Reads specs from `/specs/apps/crud/be/gherkin/` (mounted volume)
- Not cached — always runs fresh
- Used by `test:integration` target

### End-to-End Tests

- Covered by `crud-be-e2e` (Playwright) running against the full deployed stack
- Not part of this project's targets

### Running Integration Tests

```bash
# Runs PostgreSQL + test-runner in Docker, tears down on completion
nx run crud-be-rust-axum:test:integration
```
