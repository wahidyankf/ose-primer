# crud-fe-e2e

End-to-end tests for all [demo-fe frontends](../../specs/apps/crud/fe/README.md),
using [playwright-bdd](https://github.com/vitalets/playwright-bdd) to drive tests from Gherkin
feature files.

Tests use Playwright to drive a real browser against a running frontend + backend stack.

## What This Tests

Feature files in [`specs/apps/crud/fe/gherkin/`](../../specs/apps/crud/fe/gherkin/README.md) are the source of truth:

- `health/` - Service health status indicator
- `authentication/` - Login form, session lifecycle, logout
- `user-lifecycle/` - Registration, profile management, password change
- `security/` - Password complexity, account lockout, admin unlock
- `token-management/` - Session info, token verification
- `admin/` - User listing, search, disable/enable
- `expenses/` - CRUD UI, currency, units, reporting, attachments
- `layout/` - Responsive design, WCAG accessibility

## Architecture

```
specs/apps/crud/fe/gherkin/**/*.feature    <- source of truth (read-only)
        |
        v  (defineBddConfig reads features)
playwright.config.ts
        |
        v  (bddgen generates)
.features-gen/**/*.spec.ts            <- auto-generated, gitignored
        |
        v  (playwright test runs)
tests/steps/**/*.ts                   <- step implementations
```

## Tested Frontends

This centralized E2E suite tests any demo-fe frontend by setting `BASE_URL`:

| Frontend            | Framework               | Default Port |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------ |
| `crud-fe-ts-nextjs` | Next.js 16 (App Router) | 3301         |

## Prerequisites

The frontend must be running on `http://localhost:3301` (or the URL set via `BASE_URL`) and a
backend must be running on `http://localhost:8201` before executing tests.

**Start a backend**:

```bash
nx dev crud-be-golang-gin
```

**Start a frontend**:

```bash
nx dev crud-fe-ts-nextjs
```

## Setup

Install Playwright and its dependencies (one-time setup):

```bash
nx install crud-fe-e2e
cd apps/crud-fe-e2e && npx playwright install --with-deps chromium && cd ../..
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all BDD E2E tests headlessly (generates specs then runs)
nx run crud-fe-e2e:test:e2e

# Run with interactive Playwright UI
nx run crud-fe-e2e:test:e2e:ui

# View HTML report from last run
nx run crud-fe-e2e:test:e2e:report

# Generate spec files only (without running tests)
cd apps/crud-fe-e2e && npx bddgen

# Lint TypeScript source files (oxlint)
nx run crud-fe-e2e:lint

# Type check
nx typecheck crud-fe-e2e

# Pre-push quality gate (typecheck + lint)
nx run crud-fe-e2e:test:quick
```

**See**: [Nx Target Standards](../../governance/development/infra/nx-targets.md) for canonical E2E target names. `test:e2e` runs only on manual `workflow_dispatch` from the GitHub Actions UI, not on pre-push (cron schedules removed to conserve CI resources).

## CI Integration

This suite runs in two contexts:

1. **`test-crud-fe-ts-nextjs.yml`** — the dedicated frontend workflow. Triggers on changes to `crud-fe-ts-nextjs`, `crud-fe-e2e`, or `crud-be-golang-gin`. Always uses the Go/Gin backend stack via `infra/dev/crud-fe-ts-nextjs/docker-compose.yml`.

2. **Each `test-crud-be-*.yml` backend workflow** — after the backend's integration and BE E2E tests pass, an `e2e-fe` job runs on a fresh runner. It starts the **same backend** being tested (with `ENABLE_TEST_API=true`) alongside the Next.js frontend via that backend's `infra/dev/crud-be-<name>/docker-compose.ci.yml` overlay. This validates that the frontend works end-to-end against every supported backend — not just Go/Gin.

## Environment Variables

| Variable   | Default                 | Description                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:3301` | Frontend base URL               |
| `CI`       | unset                   | Enables CI mode (single worker) |

Override the base URL to test a different frontend:

```bash
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3301 nx run crud-fe-e2e:test:e2e
```
