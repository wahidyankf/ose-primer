**Need reliable end-to-end testing for modern web apps?** Playwright is Microsoft's open-source automation framework that enables fast, reliable testing across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with a single API.

## What Is Playwright?

Playwright is a **Node.js library** for automating web browsers. It provides a high-level API to control headless or headed browsers, enabling automated testing, web scraping, and browser automation tasks.

**Key capabilities**:

- **Cross-browser**: Test in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit (Safari) with the same code
- **Auto-wait**: Built-in waiting for elements to be actionable (no manual waits needed)
- **Multiple contexts**: Simulate multiple users with isolated browser contexts
- **Network control**: Intercept and modify network requests for mocking and testing
- **Trace viewer**: Visual debugging with timeline, screenshots, and network logs
- **TypeScript-first**: Written in TypeScript with excellent type support

Unlike Selenium which requires browser drivers and explicit waits, Playwright automatically waits for elements to be ready and provides a more reliable testing experience.

## Why Playwright for Automation Testing?

**Modern architecture**:

- **Auto-waiting**: Playwright waits for elements to be visible, enabled, and stable before acting—eliminating flaky tests from timing issues
- **Browser contexts**: Create isolated browser sessions without launching new browser instances (fast parallel testing)
- **Built-in retry**: Automatic retries for flaky network requests and actions
- **Web-first assertions**: Assertions that automatically retry until conditions are met (expect(page).toHaveTitle())

**Developer experience**:

- **Codegen**: Generate test code by recording browser interactions
- **Inspector**: Step through tests interactively with breakpoints
- **Trace viewer**: Post-mortem debugging with complete timeline
- **TypeScript support**: First-class TypeScript integration with strong typing

**Performance**:

- **Parallel execution**: Run tests in parallel across multiple workers
- **Sharding**: Distribute tests across multiple machines
- **Fast execution**: No overhead from browser drivers or coordination servers

## When to Use Playwright

**Ideal for**:

- End-to-end testing of web applications
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- API testing combined with UI testing
- Visual regression testing with screenshot comparison
- Testing single-page applications (React, Vue, Angular)
- CI/CD pipeline integration

**Not ideal for**:

- Mobile native app testing (use Appium instead)
- Load testing (use k6, JMeter, or similar)
- Simple API-only testing (use Axios or fetch directly)
- Testing without browser context (Playwright requires browser)

**Playwright vs. Selenium**: Playwright provides automatic waiting, better debugging, faster execution, and cross-browser support without external drivers. Selenium has broader language support (Java, Python, C#) but requires more manual configuration.

**Playwright vs. Cypress**: Playwright supports multiple browser engines (including WebKit), runs outside the browser process (no browser limitations), and has better support for multi-tab/multi-window testing. Cypress runs inside the browser and has simpler syntax but more limitations.

## Learning Paths

**Multiple ways to learn Playwright**:

1. **[Initial Setup](/en/learn/software-engineering/automation-testing/tools/playwright/initial-setup)** - Install Playwright, configure project, run first test
2. **[Quick Start](/en/learn/software-engineering/automation-testing/tools/playwright/quick-start)** - Complete working example with step-by-step walkthrough (5-30% coverage)
3. **[By Example](/en/learn/software-engineering/automation-testing/tools/playwright/by-example)** - 85 annotated code examples covering 95% of Playwright features

**Recommended path for experienced developers**: Start with Initial Setup → Quick Start → By Example for comprehensive learning.

**Recommended path for beginners**: Initial Setup → Quick Start → Practice with real projects → By Example for reference.

## Prerequisites

**Before learning Playwright, you should understand TypeScript fundamentals:**

Playwright is written in TypeScript and provides first-class TypeScript support. To effectively use Playwright, you need to understand core TypeScript concepts that Playwright builds upon.

**Required Foundation**: [TypeScript Programming Language](/en/learn/software-engineering/programming-languages/typescript)

## Foundation Concepts

Understanding these TypeScript concepts is essential before using Playwright:

**Core TypeScript Concepts:**

- **[Type Annotations](/en/learn/software-engineering/programming-languages/typescript/overview#type-system-mastery)** - Type safety for test code and page objects
- **[Async/Await](/en/learn/software-engineering/programming-languages/typescript/by-example/intermediate)** - Asynchronous operations in browser automation
- **[Interfaces and Types](/en/learn/software-engineering/programming-languages/typescript/in-the-field/type-safety)** - Type-safe test fixtures and page object contracts
- **[Generics](/en/learn/software-engineering/programming-languages/typescript/by-example/intermediate)** - Reusable test utilities and helpers
- **[Union and Intersection Types](/en/learn/software-engineering/programming-languages/typescript/by-example/beginner)** - Flexible test data structures

**Required Skills:**

- Node.js 18+ installed
- TypeScript fundamentals (type annotations, interfaces, async/await)
- Understanding of web fundamentals (HTML, CSS, DOM)
- Basic command-line proficiency

**Recommended (helpful but not required)**:

- Experience with testing frameworks (Jest, Mocha)
- Understanding of CSS selectors
- Familiarity with page object pattern

**Playwright adds**: Auto-waiting, cross-browser support, trace viewer, and network interception on top of these TypeScript concepts.

**Why This Matters**: Playwright's API is fully typed. Understanding TypeScript helps you write type-safe tests, leverage autocomplete, and catch errors at compile time.

**If you're new to TypeScript**, start with [TypeScript Learning Path](/en/learn/software-engineering/programming-languages/typescript) to learn the foundational concepts, then return to Playwright to learn how to write reliable end-to-end tests.

## Key Features

### Auto-Waiting and Reliability

Playwright automatically waits for elements to be actionable before performing actions:

- **Visible**: Element is visible in viewport
- **Stable**: Element has stopped moving/animating
- **Enabled**: Element is not disabled
- **Attached**: Element is attached to DOM

This eliminates the need for manual `sleep()` or explicit waits, reducing test flakiness.

### Cross-Browser Testing

Single codebase runs in all major browser engines:

- **Chromium**: Chrome, Edge, Brave (most popular browsers)
- **Firefox**: Mozilla Firefox
- **WebKit**: Safari engine (macOS and iOS rendering)

Each browser is automatically downloaded and managed by Playwright—no manual driver installation.

### Trace Viewer and Debugging

When tests fail, Playwright's trace viewer provides:

- Complete timeline of actions
- Screenshots before/after each action
- Network activity and API calls
- Console logs and errors
- DOM snapshots at each step

This makes debugging failed tests straightforward instead of mysterious.

### Parallel Execution and Sharding

Playwright runs tests in parallel by default:

- **Workers**: Run tests in parallel processes (configurable)
- **Sharding**: Distribute tests across machines in CI
- **Isolation**: Each test gets fresh browser context (no state leakage)

This keeps test suites fast even as they grow.

## TypeScript Integration

Playwright is written in TypeScript and provides excellent type safety:

```typescript
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";

test("has title", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("https://playwright.dev/");
  // TypeScript autocomplete for all Playwright methods
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Playwright/);
});
```

All Playwright APIs are fully typed, providing autocomplete and type checking out of the box.

## Next Steps

Choose your learning path:

- **[Initial Setup](/en/learn/software-engineering/automation-testing/tools/playwright/initial-setup)** - Get Playwright installed and running
- **[Quick Start](/en/learn/software-engineering/automation-testing/tools/playwright/quick-start)** - Build your first complete test
- **[By Example](/en/learn/software-engineering/automation-testing/tools/playwright/by-example)** - Learn through 85 annotated examples
