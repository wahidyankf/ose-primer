The Linux Command-Line By Example tutorial provides hands-on learning through practical, annotated code examples. This tutorial targets experienced developers who want to quickly understand command-line patterns and shell scripting techniques through direct code exploration.

## Tutorial Approach

This tutorial follows the **by-example** methodology:

- **Code-first learning** - Examples presented with minimal prose
- **Annotated commands** - Inline comments explain syntax and behavior
- **Progressive complexity** - Examples build from basic to advanced patterns
- **Real-world scenarios** - Commands and scripts based on practical use cases
- **Immediate applicability** - Copy, modify, and use examples in actual work

## What You'll Learn

By working through these examples, you'll understand:

- **Shell Basics** - Command syntax, options, arguments, and shell behavior
- **File System Navigation** - Moving through directories and locating files
- **File Operations** - Creating, copying, moving, deleting, and managing files
- **Text Processing** - Searching, filtering, transforming, and analyzing text
- **Pipes and Redirection** - Combining commands and controlling I/O streams
- **Process Management** - Monitoring, controlling, and scheduling processes
- **Shell Scripting** - Writing reusable automation scripts
- **Environment Configuration** - Customizing shell behavior and profiles
- **Command Composition** - Building complex workflows from simple commands

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes:

- **Linux access** - WSL, virtual machine, or native Linux installation
- **Terminal familiarity** - Comfort opening and using a terminal emulator
- **Programming experience** - Understanding of variables, loops, and conditionals
- **Text editor skills** - Ability to create and edit text files

No prior shell scripting experience required - the examples teach through demonstration.

## Coverage Overview

This tutorial provides **95% coverage** of essential Linux shell skills through **80 annotated examples**, organized into three levels:

### Beginner Level (Examples 1-30, 0-40% Coverage)

- **Basic Commands**: echo, ls, cd, pwd, mkdir, rm, cp, mv, touch, cat
- **File Viewing**: less, head, tail, wc
- **Text Search**: grep, find
- **Pipes & Redirection**: |, >, >>, <, 2>&1, tee
- **Variables**: assignment, expansion, command substitution, environment
- **Conditionals**: if/else, test, [[]], case
- **Loops**: for, while, arrays
- **Functions**: definition, arguments, return values

### Intermediate Level (Examples 31-55, 40-75% Coverage)

- **Text Processing**: sed, awk for log analysis and data transformation
- **Scripting Patterns**: argument parsing, error handling, exit codes
- **Process Management**: ps, kill, jobs, signals
- **Permissions**: chmod, chown, file security
- **Archiving**: tar, gzip, zip for backups
- **Network**: curl, wget, ssh, scp, rsync
- **Scheduling**: cron, at for automation
- **Best Practices**: production-ready script patterns

### Advanced Level (Examples 56-80, 75-95% Coverage)

- **Advanced Scripting**: Complex automation, error handling patterns
- **Signal Handling**: Trap commands, process lifecycle management
- **Performance**: Optimization techniques, parallel processing
- **Debugging**: Advanced troubleshooting, script profiling
- **System Administration**: User management, service configuration
- **Security**: Secure scripting patterns, permission handling
- **Production Patterns**: Enterprise-grade scripts, monitoring integration

## How to Use This Tutorial

1. **Read the code** - Study each example to understand command structure
2. **Run the commands** - Execute examples in your terminal to see results
3. **Modify and experiment** - Change parameters to explore command behavior
4. **Apply to projects** - Adapt examples to solve real problems in your work
5. **Reference later** - Return to specific examples when facing similar tasks

## Example Format

Examples follow a consistent annotation pattern:

```bash
# Descriptive comment explaining the command's purpose
command --option argument  # Inline note about specific syntax

# Multi-line examples include step-by-step comments
variable="value"           # Variable assignment
echo "$variable"           # Variable expansion in double quotes
```

## What is "By Example"?

By-example tutorials are **code-first learning materials** designed for experienced developers switching to or deepening their Linux shell knowledge. Unlike narrative tutorials, by-example focuses on:

- **Working, runnable code** - Every example is copy-paste-executable
- **Heavy annotations** - Inline comments with `# =>` notation show outputs and states
- **Self-contained examples** - Each example includes all necessary context
- **Production relevance** - Real-world patterns used in actual work
- **Progressive complexity** - Examples build from basics to production patterns

## Tutorial Structure

- **Examples 1-30 (Beginner)**: Core commands, file operations, basic scripting (0-40% coverage)
- **Examples 31-55 (Intermediate)**: Text processing, automation, production patterns (40-75% coverage)
- **Examples 56-80 (Advanced)**: Performance, debugging, system administration, security patterns (75-95% coverage)
