description: Build production-ready enterprise applications with Spring Boot using Java or Kotlin on the JVM platform
---

Spring Boot is an opinionated framework built on the Spring ecosystem that simplifies the creation of production-ready, stand-alone Spring applications using Java or Kotlin. It provides convention-over-configuration defaults while maintaining full flexibility for customization.

**Java or Kotlin?** Both languages are first-class citizens in Spring Boot. All examples in this guide are provided in both Java and Kotlin, allowing you to learn Spring Boot concepts in your preferred JVM language.

## What You'll Learn

- **Spring Boot Fundamentals** - Auto-configuration, starters, and application structure
- **REST API Development** - Controllers, request mapping, and response handling
- **Data Access** - Spring Data JPA, repositories, and database integration
- **Security** - Authentication, authorization, and Spring Security configuration
- **Testing** - Unit tests, integration tests, and test containers
- **Production Features** - Actuator, monitoring, logging, and deployment

## Prerequisites

**Before learning Spring Boot, you should understand Spring Framework fundamentals:**

Spring Boot is built on top of the Spring Framework and provides auto-configuration and opinionated defaults. To effectively use Spring Boot, you need to understand the core Spring concepts that Spring Boot builds upon.

**Required Foundation**: [JVM Spring Framework](/en/learn/software-engineering/platform-web/tools/jvm-spring)

## Foundation Concepts

Understanding these Spring Framework concepts is essential before using Spring Boot:

**Core Spring Concepts:**

- **[Spring IoC Container](/en/learn/software-engineering/platform-web/tools/jvm-spring/overview#ioc-container)** - How Spring manages bean lifecycles and dependencies
- **[Dependency Injection](/en/learn/software-engineering/platform-web/tools/jvm-spring/in-the-field/dependency-injection)** - Constructor injection, @Autowired, bean wiring patterns
- **[Java-Based Configuration](/en/learn/software-engineering/platform-web/tools/jvm-spring/in-the-field/configuration)** - @Configuration, @Bean, component scanning
- **[Bean Lifecycle](/en/learn/software-engineering/platform-web/tools/jvm-spring/in-the-field/bean-lifecycle)** - Initialization hooks, destruction callbacks, bean scopes
- **[Component Scanning](/en/learn/software-engineering/platform-web/tools/jvm-spring/in-the-field/component-scanning)** - @Component, @Service, @Repository stereotypes

**Data Access:**

- **[Spring JDBC](/en/learn/software-engineering/platform-web/tools/jvm-spring/in-the-field/spring-jdbc)** - JdbcTemplate for database access
- **[Spring Data JPA](/en/learn/software-engineering/platform-web/tools/jvm-spring/in-the-field/spring-data-jpa)** - Repository pattern and entity management
- **[Transaction Management](/en/learn/software-engineering/platform-web/tools/jvm-spring/in-the-field/transaction-management)** - @Transactional and propagation

**Web Development:**

- **[Spring MVC](/en/learn/software-engineering/platform-web/tools/jvm-spring/in-the-field/spring-mvc)** - DispatcherServlet, controllers, view resolution
- **[REST APIs](/en/learn/software-engineering/platform-web/tools/jvm-spring/in-the-field/rest-apis)** - @RestController, ResponseEntity, content negotiation

**Spring Boot adds**: Auto-configuration, embedded servers, starter dependencies, production-ready features (Actuator), and opinionated defaults on top of these core Spring concepts.

**Why This Matters**: Spring Boot auto-configures these concepts. Understanding manual Spring setup helps troubleshoot when auto-configuration doesn't match your needs.

**If you're new to Spring**, start with [JVM Spring Framework](/en/learn/software-engineering/platform-web/tools/jvm-spring) to learn the foundational concepts, then return to Spring Boot to learn how it simplifies Spring application development.

## Platform Characteristics

### Convention Over Configuration

Spring Boot eliminates boilerplate configuration through intelligent defaults and auto-configuration. Start building features immediately without extensive XML or annotation setup.

### Enterprise-Grade Ecosystem

Access the complete Spring ecosystem including Spring Data, Spring Security, Spring Cloud, and Spring Batch. Build everything from simple REST APIs to complex microservices architectures.

### Production-Ready Features

Spring Boot Actuator provides built-in health checks, metrics, and monitoring endpoints. Applications come ready for production deployment with minimal additional configuration.

### Broad Database Support

Spring Data JPA abstracts database interactions with repository patterns supporting PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, MongoDB, and many other data stores through consistent interfaces.

## Getting Started

Before diving into Spring Boot development, get up and running:

1. **[Initial Setup](/en/learn/software-engineering/platform-web/tools/jvm-spring-boot/initial-setup)** - Install Java/Kotlin, Maven/Gradle, IDE, Spring Initializr, verify your setup
2. **[Quick Start](/en/learn/software-engineering/platform-web/tools/jvm-spring-boot/quick-start)** - Your first Spring Boot app, basic REST API, essential patterns

These foundational tutorials (0-30% coverage) prepare you for comprehensive Spring Boot learning in both Java and Kotlin.

Spring Boot development typically progresses through:

1. **Project Initialization** - Spring Initializr and dependency management
2. **Core Concepts** - Controllers, services, repositories, and entities
3. **REST API Design** - Building RESTful web services
4. **Database Integration** - JPA entities, repositories, and migrations
5. **Security Implementation** - Authentication and authorization patterns
6. **Testing Strategies** - Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing
7. **Deployment** - Packaging and deployment to cloud platforms

## Common Use Cases

## Prerequisites

### For Java/Kotlin Developers New to Spring

- **Java 17+ or Kotlin 1.9+ installed** - Spring Boot 3.x requires Java 17 minimum (Java 21+ recommended) or Kotlin 1.9+
- **Maven or Gradle** - Understanding of dependency management and build tools (Maven 3.6+ or Gradle 7.5+, Gradle recommended for Kotlin)
- **Java or Kotlin fundamentals** - OOP principles, collections, streams/sequences, lambda expressions/higher-order functions, annotations, generics
- **HTTP and REST** - HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), status codes (200, 404, 500), JSON serialization
- **SQL basics** - SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, JOINs for database examples
- **IDE** - IntelliJ IDEA (best Kotlin support), Eclipse, or VS Code with Java/Kotlin extensions

### For Python/Ruby Developers Switching to Java/Spring

- **Java learning curve** - Expect 2-4 weeks for Java syntax (static typing, verbosity, compilation)
- **Annotation-driven configuration** - Spring uses annotations (`@Controller`, `@Service`) instead of Rails conventions or Django decorators
- **Dependency injection** - Different from Django's explicit imports or Rails' ActiveSupport autoloading
- **Statically typed** - Compile-time type checking vs Python/Ruby's dynamic typing
- **Build tools** - Maven/Gradle replaces pip/bundler; pom.xml/build.gradle vs requirements.txt/Gemfile
- **JVM ecosystem** - Understanding classpath, JAR files, and JVM startup differs from interpreted languages

### For C# Developers Coming from .NET

- **Framework similarities** - Spring Boot resembles ASP.NET Core (dependency injection, middleware, MVC)
- **Annotation syntax** - Spring's `@Autowired` similar to .NET's `[Inject]`, `@RestController` similar to `[ApiController]`
- **Package management** - Maven/Gradle analogous to NuGet
- **Platform differences** - JVM ecosystem vs .NET runtime; Java 17 vs C# 11 language features
- **Tooling** - IntelliJ IDEA vs Visual Studio; similar refactoring and debugging capabilities

### For Node.js/Express Developers Switching to JVM

- **Static typing** - Java requires type declarations; TypeScript experience helps but Java is more verbose
- **Synchronous by default** - Spring Boot MVC is blocking (thread-per-request); use WebFlux for async patterns like Express
- **Dependency injection** - Spring's IoC container vs Express's manual require/import and middleware chaining
- **Build process** - Compilation step (Maven/Gradle) vs npm's direct execution
- **Performance characteristics** - JVM warmup vs V8's immediate execution; different memory management

### For Complete Framework Beginners

- **Start with Java fundamentals** - Complete Java basics before tackling Spring Boot
- **Understand web concepts** - HTTP, REST, JSON, client-server architecture
- **Follow beginner examples** - Start with Example 1 and progress sequentially through all 25 beginner examples
- **Build projects** - Hands-on practice essential; theory alone insufficient for framework mastery
- **Use Spring Initializr** - Start projects via start.spring.io for proper dependency setup
