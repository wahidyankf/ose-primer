description: Build real-time, fault-tolerant web applications with Phoenix Framework on the Elixir platform
---

Phoenix is a web framework built with Elixir that leverages the power of the Erlang VM (BEAM) to deliver high-performance, real-time web applications with exceptional fault tolerance and concurrency.

## What You'll Learn

- **Phoenix Framework Basics** - MVC architecture, routing, controllers, and views
- **LiveView** - Building real-time, interactive UIs without JavaScript
- **Ecto Database Layer** - Schema definitions, queries, migrations, and changesets
- **Channels & PubSub** - Real-time bidirectional communication
- **Deployment** - Production deployment strategies for Phoenix applications
- **OTP Principles** - Supervision trees, GenServers, and fault tolerance

## Platform Characteristics

### Real-Time by Default

Phoenix includes first-class support for real-time features through Channels and LiveView. Build interactive, low-latency applications that push updates to clients instantly without complex JavaScript frameworks.

### Fault-Tolerant Architecture

Built on the Erlang VM, Phoenix applications inherit decades of battle-tested fault tolerance patterns. Processes crash and restart automatically, ensuring your application stays available even under failure conditions.

### Scalability & Performance

The BEAM VM's lightweight processes and efficient scheduling enable Phoenix to handle millions of concurrent connections on a single server. Horizontal scaling is straightforward with distributed Erlang clustering.

### Developer Productivity

Phoenix provides a productive development experience with code reloading, comprehensive testing tools, and a clear MVC structure. LiveView enables building rich UIs with minimal JavaScript.

## Getting Started

Before diving into Phoenix development, get up and running:

1. **[Initial Setup](/en/learn/software-engineering/platform-web/tools/elixir-phoenix/initial-setup)** - Install Elixir, Phoenix, PostgreSQL, Node.js, verify your setup
2. **[Quick Start](/en/learn/software-engineering/platform-web/tools/elixir-phoenix/quick-start)** - Your first Phoenix app, basic routing, essential patterns

## Phoenix Versions & Compatibility

### Version Requirements

- **Phoenix 1.7+** (Current) - Requires Elixir 1.14+, Erlang/OTP 24+, introduces verified routes (~p sigil), function components, unified HEEx templates
- **Phoenix 1.6** (Legacy) - Supports Elixir 1.12+, Erlang/OTP 22+, uses traditional view layer and template helpers
- **Migration Path** - Upgrading 1.6 to 1.7 requires refactoring views to function components, updating route helpers to verified routes
- **Long-Term Support** - Phoenix 1.7 recommended for new projects; 1.6 receives security patches but limited feature development

### Component Version Compatibility

- **Elixir Version** - Phoenix 1.7 requires Elixir 1.14 minimum (Elixir 1.15+ recommended for latest language features)
- **Erlang/OTP** - OTP 24+ required for Phoenix 1.7; OTP 26+ recommended for performance improvements
- **Phoenix LiveView** - Phoenix 1.7 works with LiveView 0.18+; LiveView 0.20+ adds declarative form bindings and async result handling
- **Ecto** - Ecto 3.10+ for Phoenix 1.7; Ecto 3.11+ recommended for improved query performance
- **Phoenix PubSub** - Phoenix PubSub 2.1+ for distributed messaging
- **Database Adapters** - Postgrex 0.16+ for PostgreSQL, MyXQL 0.6+ for MySQL

### Project Templates

Phoenix provides project generator options for different application types:

- **Default (Full)** - `mix phx.new my_app` - Complete Phoenix with Ecto, LiveView, HTML templates, asset pipeline
- **API Only** - `mix phx.new my_app --no-html --no-assets` - JSON API backend without frontend
- **No Ecto** - `mix phx.new my_app --no-ecto` - Phoenix without database layer (for microservices or external datastores)
- **No LiveView** - `mix phx.new my_app --no-live` - Traditional request-response without LiveView (rare, LiveView recommended)
- **Binary IDs** - `mix phx.new my_app --binary-id` - Use UUIDs instead of integer primary keys for distributed systems
- **Database Choice** - `--database postgres|mysql|mssql|sqlite` - PostgreSQL default, MySQL/MSSQL/SQLite alternatives

## Prerequisites

### For Elixir Developers New to Phoenix

- **Elixir 1.14+ installed** - Phoenix 1.7 requires Elixir 1.14 minimum (install via asdf, Homebrew, or distribution packages)
- **Erlang/OTP 24+** - BEAM VM runtime (typically installed automatically with Elixir)
- **PostgreSQL** - Default database for Phoenix (PostgreSQL 12+ recommended); alternatives include MySQL, MSSQL, SQLite
- **Node.js** - Asset compilation with esbuild (Node.js 14+ required for development)
- **Elixir fundamentals** - Pattern matching, pipe operator, modules, functions, processes, basic OTP (GenServer, Supervisor)
- **HTTP and REST** - HTTP methods, status codes, JSON serialization for API development
- **SQL basics** - SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, JOINs for Ecto examples

### For Ruby/Rails Developers Switching to Phoenix

- **Functional programming mindset** - Immutable data structures vs Rails' mutable ActiveRecord objects
- **Explicit over implicit** - Phoenix contexts explicitly define boundaries vs Rails' magic associations
- **Process-based architecture** - Lightweight BEAM processes vs Rails' thread-per-request model
- **Pattern matching** - Elixir's pattern matching replaces conditional logic common in Ruby
- **Ecto vs ActiveRecord** - Ecto separates schemas from queries; ActiveRecord combines them
- **Asset pipeline differences** - Phoenix uses esbuild/Tailwind vs Rails' Webpacker/Sprockets
- **Learning curve** - Expect 2-3 weeks for Elixir syntax; functional paradigm shift takes longer

### For Python/Django Developers Switching to Phoenix

- **Functional programming** - Elixir's immutable data and pattern matching vs Python's multi-paradigm approach
- **Concurrency model** - BEAM's lightweight processes vs Django's threading/async views
- **Context boundaries** - Phoenix contexts similar to Django apps but more explicit
- **Ecto vs Django ORM** - Ecto uses changesets for validation; Django uses model forms
- **Template differences** - HEEx templates vs Django templates; similar syntax but different rendering
- **Admin interface** - Phoenix lacks Django's built-in admin; use ExAdmin or custom LiveView dashboards
- **Deployment model** - Mix releases vs WSGI servers; Phoenix compiles to single binary

### For Node.js Developers Switching to Phoenix

- **Functional vs imperative** - Elixir's functional approach vs JavaScript's imperative/functional hybrid
- **Static typing optional** - Elixir uses Dialyzer for type checking; TypeScript-like but less enforced
- **Process concurrency** - BEAM's lightweight processes vs Node.js event loop and worker threads
- **LiveView vs React/Vue** - Server-rendered interactivity vs client-side JavaScript frameworks
- **Ecto vs Sequelize/Prisma** - Different query building; Ecto more composable
- **Async patterns** - Phoenix LiveView handles real-time without callbacks/promises complexity
- **Package management** - Hex (similar to npm) with Mix as task runner

### For Complete Framework Beginners

- **Start with Elixir fundamentals** - Complete Elixir basics before Phoenix (1-2 weeks minimum)
- **Understand functional programming** - Immutability, recursion, pattern matching, higher-order functions
- **Learn OTP basics** - GenServer, Supervisor, process communication for fault tolerance understanding
- **Follow beginner examples** - Start with Example 1 and progress through all 25 beginner examples
- **Build projects** - Create small Phoenix apps (blog, todo list, chat) for hands-on practice
- **Use Phoenix generators** - Run `mix phx.gen.html` and `mix phx.gen.live` to see idiomatic code structure
