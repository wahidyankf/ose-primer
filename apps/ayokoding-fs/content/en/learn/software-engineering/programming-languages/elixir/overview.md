description: Learn Elixir from basics to advanced - functional programming, OTP platform, Phoenix framework, and fault-tolerant systems
---

Welcome to ayokoding's comprehensive Elixir guide. Master functional programming, concurrent systems, and fault-tolerant applications with the BEAM VM.

## What is Elixir?

Elixir is a functional, concurrent programming language that runs on the Erlang VM (BEAM). It combines:

- **Functional Programming**: Immutability, pattern matching, and higher-order functions
- **OTP Platform**: Battle-tested concurrency and fault tolerance from Erlang
- **Modern Syntax**: Ruby-inspired syntax with metaprogramming capabilities
- **Phoenix Framework**: High-performance web development with LiveView
- **Scalability**: Millions of concurrent connections on a single machine

## Why Learn Elixir?

Elixir excels in domains requiring:

- **Real-time Systems**: Chat applications, multiplayer games, IoT platforms
- **Fault Tolerance**: Systems that must never stop (telecom, fintech, healthcare)
- **Concurrency**: Handling millions of users simultaneously
- **Web Development**: Modern web apps with Phoenix and LiveView
- **Distributed Systems**: Multi-node applications with built-in distribution

## Who Is This For?

This guide serves:

- **Beginners**: New to functional programming or Elixir
- **OOP Developers**: Transitioning from Java, Python, or Ruby
- **Backend Engineers**: Building scalable web services
- **System Architects**: Designing fault-tolerant distributed systems

## Getting Started

Before diving into comprehensive tutorials, get up and running:

1. **[Initial Setup](/en/learn/software-engineering/programming-languages/elixir/initial-setup)** - Install Elixir, configure your environment, set up Phoenix, verify your setup
2. **[Quick Start](/en/learn/software-engineering/programming-languages/elixir/quick-start)** - Your first Elixir program, IEx basics, pattern matching introduction

These foundational tutorials (0-30% coverage) prepare you for the complete learning path.

## Learning Path

We provide progressive content organized by the Diataxis framework:

### Tutorials (3 Levels)

- **Beginner** (0-60%): Complete language fundamentals
- **Intermediate** (60-85%): OTP, Phoenix, Ecto, production patterns
- **Advanced** (85-95%): BEAM internals, distributed systems, metaprogramming

### How-To Guides

- **Cookbook**: 35-40 ready-to-use recipes for common patterns
- **18+ Guides**: Specific solutions (GenServer, Phoenix, Ecto, testing, etc.)

### Explanation

- **Best Practices**: Elixir idioms and "what makes Elixir special"
- **Anti-Patterns**: Common mistakes from OOP backgrounds

### Reference

- **Cheat Sheet**: Quick syntax and function reference
- **Glossary**: Elixir/OTP/Phoenix terminology
- **Resources**: Official docs, books, community links

## What Makes Elixir Special?

### 1. The BEAM VM

Built on 30+ years of Erlang VM development:

- **Preemptive Scheduling**: Fair CPU distribution across processes
- **Fault Tolerance**: Supervision trees restart failed processes
- **Hot Code Swapping**: Update code without stopping the system
- **Distribution**: Multi-node clustering out of the box

### 2. The Actor Model

Lightweight processes (not OS threads):

- **Millions of Processes**: Each with isolated state
- **Message Passing**: Share nothing, communicate via messages
- **Fault Isolation**: One process crash doesn't affect others

### 3. Functional Programming

Immutability and pure functions:

- **Predictability**: No hidden state changes
- **Concurrency Safety**: No race conditions on shared state
- **Pattern Matching**: Elegant control flow and data transformation

### 4. Modern Ecosystem

Production-ready tools:

- **Mix**: Build tool, dependency manager, task runner
- **Phoenix**: Web framework rivaling Node.js/Rails performance
- **LiveView**: Real-time UIs without JavaScript
- **Ecto**: Database wrapper with composable queries

## Version Coverage

This guide covers:

- **Elixir**: 1.14+ (compatible with current stable 1.19)
- **OTP**: Version compatibility depends on Elixir version:
  - Elixir 1.14: OTP 23-26 (OTP 26 from v1.14.5)
  - Elixir 1.15-1.16: OTP 24-26
  - Elixir 1.17-1.18: OTP 25-27
  - Elixir 1.19: OTP 26-28 (minimum 26.0)
- **Phoenix**: 1.7+ (compatible with current stable 1.8)
- **Ecto**: 3.10+ (compatible with current stable 3.13)

All examples run on Elixir 1.14+ and are forward-compatible with newer versions.

## How to Use This Guide

1. **Complete Beginners**: Start with Beginner tutorial
2. **Experienced Programmers**: Begin with Beginner, advance to Intermediate
3. **Specific Problems**: Use Cookbook or How-To Guides
4. **Best Practices**: Read Explanation documents after tutorials

Each tutorial builds on previous knowledge. Cross-references link related content.
