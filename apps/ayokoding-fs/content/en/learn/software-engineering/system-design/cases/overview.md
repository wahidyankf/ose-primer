System design case studies provide hands-on learning through real-world scenarios. Each case walks you through designing a complete system from requirements to deployment, covering architectural decisions, trade-offs, and scaling strategies at multiple levels.

## 🎯 What Makes These Cases Special

**Progressive Scaling Philosophy**:
Unlike many resources that focus only on planet-scale systems, these cases cover **five scale levels**:

- **Startup scale** (0–1K users): Simple architecture, single server, minimal infrastructure
- **Small scale** (1K–10K users): Horizontal scaling, database replication, basic load balancing
- **Medium scale** (10K–100K users): CDN, distributed caching, auto-scaling, microservices
- **Large scale** (100K–1M users): Multi-region deployment, sharding, advanced caching
- **Planet scale** (1M+ users): Global distribution, event-driven architecture, big data analytics

**Why multiple scales?**

- Learn when to introduce complexity (right-sizing over over-engineering)
- Understand how systems evolve as they grow
- Make cost-effective decisions based on actual requirements
- Practice trade-off analysis at different stages

## 📋 Case Study Structure

Each case follows a comprehensive framework:

1. **Problem Statement**: Clear description of the system being designed and core requirements
2. **Requirements Analysis**: Functional and non-functional requirements (scale, latency, availability)
3. **Capacity Estimation**: Back-of-the-envelope calculations for traffic, storage, bandwidth, and compute
4. **High-Level Design**: System architecture evolution across all five scale levels
5. **Detailed Design**: Data models, APIs, processing flows, and component interactions
6. **Scalability Considerations**: When and how to introduce caching, sharding, replication, CDN, microservices
7. **Monitoring & Observability**: Metrics, logging, alerting, distributed tracing, incident response
8. **Testing Strategies**: Load testing, stress testing, chaos engineering, integration testing
9. **Security & Compliance**: Authentication, encryption, input validation, regulatory requirements
10. **Disaster Recovery**: Backup strategies, RTO/RPO targets, failover systems, business continuity
11. **Trade-offs & Alternatives**: Different approaches and their pros/cons at various scales
12. **Practice Exercises**: Hands-on challenges to test your understanding

## 🌐 Technology-Agnostic Approach

Cases focus on **architectural thinking**, not specific technologies:

- **Language-agnostic**: Principles apply to any programming language (Java, Go, Python, Node.js, etc.)
- **Tech-stack independent**: Concepts work with any database, message queue, cache, or framework
- **Architecture-first**: Emphasis on design patterns, not implementation code
- **Vendor-neutral**: Discuss components generically (e.g., "cache" not "Redis", "database" not "PostgreSQL")

You'll learn **how to think** about system design, not just memorize specific technology combinations.

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

After completing these cases, you'll be able to:

- **Decompose complex requirements** into functional and non-functional specifications
- **Estimate system capacity** for traffic, storage, and compute at different scales
- **Design data models and APIs** for various system components
- **Apply scalability patterns** like async processing, sharding, caching, and multi-region deployment
- **Balance trade-offs** between simplicity vs. scalability, cost vs. performance, build vs. buy
- **Ensure reliability** through backup strategies, disaster recovery, and incident response
- **Design for security** with proper authentication, encryption, and compliance

## 💡 How to Use These Cases

**For Learning**:

1. Read the problem statement and try designing the system yourself first
2. Compare your approach with the provided solution
3. Complete the practice exercises to reinforce concepts
4. Apply patterns to your own projects

**For Interview Preparation**:

1. Practice articulating your design decisions out loud
2. Focus on trade-off discussions and justifying choices
3. Work through capacity estimation calculations
4. Time yourself (45-60 minutes per case)

**For Professional Development**:

1. Study how systems evolve across scale levels
2. Learn when to introduce architectural complexity
3. Understand cost implications of different approaches
4. Build intuition for real-world system design

## 🚀 Getting Started

Start with the AI Personal Finance Advisor case - it covers a broad range of system design concepts including document processing, machine learning, distributed systems, and multi-region deployment.

Each case is self-contained, but they build on common patterns and principles from the [Architecture](/en/learn/software-engineering/architecture) section.
