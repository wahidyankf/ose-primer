# Formatting Conventions

Standards for markdown formatting, syntax, and visual elements in all documentation.

## Purpose

These conventions define **HOW to format markdown content** including indentation, linking, diagrams, emojis, timestamps, mathematical notation, and code fences. These are the technical formatting rules that ensure consistency and accessibility.

## Scope

**✅ Belongs Here:**

- Markdown syntax and formatting rules
- Visual element standards (diagrams, colors, emojis)
- Technical formatting specifications
- Timestamp and notation formats
- Code fence nesting rules

**❌ Does NOT Belong:**

- Content quality standards (that's writing/)
- Writing style guidelines (that's writing/)

## Conventions

- [Color Accessibility](./color-accessibility.md) - MASTER REFERENCE for all color decisions. Verified accessible color palette supporting all color blindness types
- [Diagrams and Schemas](./diagrams.md) - Standards for Mermaid diagrams (primary) and ASCII art. Includes an explicit Format Selection Rule with decision table: folder/file trees MUST use ASCII art (`├──`, `└──`, `│`); flow charts, sequence diagrams, state machines, architecture diagrams, dependency-direction, user-flow, ER/class, and C4 model diagrams MUST use Mermaid. Also contains the **UI Mockups in Plan Docs** section: both-tiers rule (low-fi ASCII + hi-fi `.excalidraw.png` or plain `.png`), design funnel (diverge → narrow → select → justify), rendering-support matrix, and ruled-out table — governing draft UI wireframes in UI-bearing plans; the **Placement HARD RULE** requires the full funnel record (all four stages, embedded mockup links) to reside in `prd.md` specifically
- [Emoji Usage](./emoji.md) - Semantic emoji usage to enhance document scannability and engagement
- [Indentation](./indentation.md) - Standard markdown indentation using 2 spaces per indentation level
- [Linking Convention](./linking.md) - Standards for linking between documentation files using GitHub-compatible markdown
- [Mathematical Notation](./mathematical-notation.md) - Standards for LaTeX notation for mathematical equations and formulas
- [Nested Code Fences](./nested-code-fences.md) - Standards for properly nesting code fences when documenting markdown structure
- [Timestamp Format](./timestamp.md) - Standard timestamp format using UTC+7 (Indonesian WIB Time)

## Principles Implemented/Respected

This set of conventions implements/respects the following core principles:

- **[Accessibility First](../../principles/content/accessibility-first.md)**: Color Accessibility Convention provides verified color-blind friendly palette, and Diagrams Convention mandates accessible color combinations for all visual elements.

- **[Explicit Over Implicit](../../principles/software-engineering/explicit-over-implicit.md)**: Indentation and Linking Conventions define explicit formatting standards, making file structure and navigation transparent through consistent rules.

- **[Simplicity Over Complexity](../../principles/general/simplicity-over-complexity.md)**: Formatting conventions use simple, consistent patterns (2-space indentation, relative paths, standard timestamps) rather than complex custom solutions.
