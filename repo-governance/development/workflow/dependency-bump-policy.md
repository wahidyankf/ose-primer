# Dependency Bump Stability & Safety Policy

Every dependency bump MUST satisfy three constraints before it is merged: (1) reproducibility via exact pinning, (2) stability via LTS-first or 60-day soak, and (3) security via CVE clearance. This rule prevents shipping fresh versions whose breakage profile is undiscovered while ensuring known vulnerabilities are patched.

## Principles Implemented/Respected

This practice implements/respects the following core principles:

- **[Reproducibility First](../../principles/software-engineering/reproducibility.md)**: All version specifications use exact pins — no caret, no tilde, no `latest`. Lockfiles are the sole source of truth for the resolved graph. Deterministic installs on every machine and CI runner.

- **[Explicit Over Implicit](../../principles/software-engineering/explicit-over-implicit.md)**: Every version is stated explicitly in manifests. Path classification (LTS / 60-day / waiver) is documented in writing. Cutoff dates are computed and recorded. No version is ever implicitly "latest".

- **[Automation Over Manual](../../principles/software-engineering/automation-over-manual.md)**: Verification commands (`grep`, `npm audit`, `govulncheck`, lockfile update commands) are prescribed steps in the application workflow so that correctness checks run mechanically rather than relying on reviewer memory.

- **[Root Cause Orientation](../../principles/general/root-cause-orientation.md)**: When a package has a CVE, the fix is to upgrade to the patched version (root cause resolved) rather than suppressing the audit warning or adding an exception comment.

- **[Deliberate Problem-Solving](../../principles/general/deliberate-problem-solving.md)**: The three-path decision tree forces explicit classification before a version is chosen. Engineers and agents state their reasoning in writing rather than picking the newest available tag reflexively.

## Conventions Implemented/Respected

This practice respects the following conventions:

- **[Reproducible Environments Convention](./reproducible-environments.md)**: Exact version pinning in `package.json`, Volta block, `go.mod`, `global.json`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, `.tool-versions`, and Dockerfiles directly implements the reproducibility standards established there.

- **[Commit Message Convention](./commit-messages.md)**: Dependency bump commits use `chore(deps): bump <package> to <version>` or `fix(deps): patch CVE-YYYY-NNNNN in <package>` per Conventional Commits format.

## Scope

### What This Policy Covers

- All `package.json` `dependencies`, `devDependencies`, `peerDependencies`, `optionalDependencies` (npm)
- All `Cargo.toml` `[dependencies]` version entries (Rust)
- All `rust-toolchain.toml` compiler-channel pins (Rust toolchain)
- All `global.json` `sdk.version` and `*.csproj`/`*.fsproj` `<PackageReference>` (.NET)
- All `package.json` `volta` block (Node.js, npm)
- All `Dockerfile` `FROM` lines and `docker-compose*.yml` `image:` references (base images)
- All GitHub Actions `uses:` references and inline version pins (CI workflow files)
- All composite-action input defaults (`.github/actions/*/action.yml`)

### What This Policy Does NOT Cover

- Workspace-internal `*` references — these resolve via npm workspaces to local paths, not the registry
- Lockfiles (`package-lock.json`, `go.sum`, etc.) — managed by tooling after manifest changes
- Type-only dev deps where the security surface is provably zero (exact pinning still recommended, but lower enforcement priority)

## Three-Path Decision Tree

For every version bump, classify the package and apply the corresponding path. Then, within whichever path applies, narrow to a single version using the two selection rules below.

### Path A — LTS Path (use latest LTS-line patch)

If the package or runtime has an officially designated LTS line, **use the latest LTS patch** regardless of recency, provided it is CVE-clean.

LTS-track packages and runtimes (non-exhaustive examples):

- Node.js (LTS lines: 22 "Jod", 24 "Krypton", etc.)
- .NET (even-numbered major versions: 6, 8, 10 are LTS)
- PostgreSQL (5-year support model — every major is effectively LTS)
- React (de facto LTS treatment for major versions)

Rationale: LTS lines have a soak and curation process built in by the upstream maintainer. Recent LTS patches inherit that soak.

### Path B — 60-Day Stable + CVE-Clean Path

If the package has no LTS designation, **use the latest version that satisfies BOTH**:

1. Released **at least 60 days** before the bump date (release date ≤ today − 60 days)
2. CVE-clean — zero known unpatched CVEs per NVD, GitHub Security Advisories, Snyk DB, and the project's own security page

Examples of non-LTS packages (most JavaScript libraries, Go, Rust, TypeScript, Tailwind, Vitest, Storybook, ESLint, Playwright, lucide-react, Zod, Shiki, mermaid, etc.).

Rationale: 60 days is the minimum soak window for the community to surface regression bugs and security issues. Most non-LTS upstreams cut patch releases monthly; 60 days catches the next-cycle fixes before the version is adopted here.

### Path C — Security-Override Waiver

When **no version satisfies BOTH the 60-day rule AND CVE-cleanness**, use the most recent CVE-patched version (or the security-recommended LTS) and document a waiver.

The waiver MUST include:

- Package name and version pinned
- The CVE(s) requiring the recent version (with NVD or GHSA URL)
- The CVE severity (Critical / High / Medium / Low)
- The release date of the pinned version
- Brief justification (e.g., "Critical RCE; no older patched version exists")
- Sign-off identity (the engineer or AI agent applying the waiver)

Waivers are documented in the plan that introduces the bump (in `tech-docs.md` under a "Security Waivers" subsection) and propagated to a long-lived `docs/reference/security-waivers.md` file (create if missing).

### KEV Fast-Track — Bypass 60-Day Soak for Actively Exploited CVEs

If any unpatched CVE affecting the **currently pinned** version appears in the CISA KEV catalog, the 60-day soak window (Path B) is **bypassed** and the bump is automatically escalated to **Path C** (Security-Override Waiver), regardless of whether a pre-cutoff version would otherwise have been eligible.

**Rationale**: CISA KEV membership confirms the CVE is weaponized in the wild. Waiting 60 days for community soak is unacceptable when active exploitation is ongoing.

**Procedure when KEV Fast-Track triggers**:

1. Look up the CVE IDs affecting the current pin in the CISA KEV JSON feed.
2. If any match: treat the bump as Path C immediately.
3. Complete the Path C waiver template; additionally record the KEV `dateAdded` field, the EPSS score, and the `knownRansomwareCampaignUse` value (`"Known"` or `"Unknown"`).
4. Append `(KEV-listed)` to the clearance status in all tables and registers.

### EPSS Escalation — Soft Urgency Signal

If the EPSS score for an unpatched CVE is **≥ 0.5** (top ~10% by exploitation likelihood within 30 days), treat the bump with Path C urgency and flag it for expedited scheduling — even if the CVE has not yet been added to KEV. Record the EPSS score and percentile in the clearance table and in `tech-docs.md`.

## Selection Rules Within Every Path

Once a path is chosen, two rules narrow the eligible set to the single version to pin. Both apply on top of paths A, B, and C — they never override the 60-day, CVE, or LTS constraints.

### Rule 5a — Recency (prefer the most recent eligible version)

Among ALL versions that satisfy the chosen path's constraints (latest LTS patch for Path A; released ≥ 60 days ago AND CVE-clean for Path B; CVE-patched for Path C), always select the **most recent eligible** version. Never pin an older eligible version when a newer eligible one exists.

Rationale: staying as current as the constraints allow minimizes the upgrade gap and accumulated drift, while rules 1–4 still bound how new "current" is allowed to be.

### Rule 5b — Functional Stability (reject versions with known fatal defects)

The selected version MUST be free of known **fatal functional defects** for the capability it provides. Reject a candidate version — even when it is CVE-clean and older than 60 days — if any of the following hold:

- It is **yanked or deprecated** on its registry (`npm view <pkg> deprecated`, crates.io yank flag, NuGet unlisted, etc.)
- It carries an **open release-blocker / regression advisory** from the upstream maintainer
- It has a **widely-reported broken-build, data-loss, or crash bug** affecting its primary function

When the newest eligible version fails this gate, fall back to the most recent eligible version that passes, and record the skip and reason (see the `FUNCTIONAL-HOLD` clearance status below).

Sources to check: the project's GitHub releases/issues page ("do not use" notices, yanked tags), the package registry deprecation flag, and the changelog/release notes known-issue callouts.

## Pinning Policy (Hard Rule)

All version specifications MUST be exact strings. No caret (`^`), no tilde (`~`), no `latest`, no `*` (except npm workspace-internal references).

| Manifest                                                | Required Form                                      | Example                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `package.json` deps / devDeps                           | Exact string                                       | `"react": "19.2.6"` (NOT `"^19.2.6"`)                                  |
| `package.json` `volta` block                            | Exact (Volta enforces this)                        | `"node": "24.13.1"`                                                    |
| `package.json` `optionalDependencies` (native binaries) | Exact                                              | `"@next/swc-linux-x64-gnu": "16.2.6"`                                  |
| `Cargo.toml` `[dependencies]`                           | Exact (no caret/tilde)                             | `axum = "0.8.4"` (NOT `axum = "^0.8"`)                                 |
| `global.json` `sdk.version`                             | Exact (`rollForward` allowed per upstream pattern) | `"version": "10.0.300"`                                                |
| Dockerfile `FROM`                                       | Exact tag (digest preferred for production)        | `FROM node:24.13.1-alpine3.23` (NOT `FROM node:24-alpine`)             |
| GitHub Actions `uses:`                                  | Pinned major OR exact SHA                          | `uses: actions/setup-node@v4` (acceptable for first-party) or `@<sha>` |
| Composite action input defaults                         | Exact                                              | `default: "1.26.3"` (NOT `default: "1.26"`)                            |

**Verification command** after every `package.json` edit:

```bash
grep -E '"\^|"~' <changed-file> && echo "FAIL: caret/tilde found" || echo "OK: all exact"
```

## CVE Clearance Process (Mandatory for Every Bump)

For every version selected (Path A, B, or C), verify CVE status against all five sources:

1. **NVD** ([nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov)) — National Vulnerability Database
2. **GitHub Security Advisories** ([github.com/advisories](https://github.com/advisories))
3. **Snyk DB** ([security.snyk.io](https://security.snyk.io))
4. **Project security page** (vendor-specific: `nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability`, `spring.io/security`, `pkg.go.dev/vuln`, dotnet release notes, etc.)
5. **CISA KEV** ([CISA KEV JSON feed](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/feeds/known_exploited_vulnerabilities.json)) — Machine-readable catalog (~1,600 entries, updated daily) of CVEs with **confirmed active exploitation in the wild**. KEV membership is a harder real-world signal than CVSS severity alone: a CVE listed here is already being weaponized. Cross-reference every CVE found in sources 1–4 against this feed using `jq '.vulnerabilities[] | select(.cveID=="CVE-YYYY-NNNNN")'`.

Additionally, record the **EPSS score** for any CVE with CVSS ≥ 7.0 using the [FIRST.org EPSS API](https://api.first.org/data/v1/epss?cve=CVE-YYYY-NNNNN) (ML-predicted probability of exploitation within 30 days, updated daily). EPSS is an informational prioritization signal, not a pass/fail gate — but see [KEV Fast-Track and EPSS Escalation](#kev-fast-track--bypass-60-day-soak-for-actively-exploited-cves) below for when it affects path classification.

The clearance status for every package records BOTH its security and its functional standing. It MUST be one of:

- **CLEAR** — No known CVEs as of the bump date, and no known fatal functional defect (Rule 5b passes)
- **CLEAR (patch-of)** — Pinned version IS the patched release for one or more known CVEs (document the CVE IDs)
- **WAIVER** — Path C applied (document waiver per the template above)
- **FUNCTIONAL-HOLD** — A newer eligible version was skipped due to a known fatal functional defect (Rule 5b); pinned to an older eligible version instead (document the skipped version, the chosen version, and the reason)

Any status MAY carry the `(KEV-listed)` suffix when the CVE was confirmed actively exploited at time of the bump (i.e., it appeared in the CISA KEV catalog). Examples: `CLEAR (patch-of, KEV-listed)`, `WAIVER (KEV-listed)`. KEV-listed entries must also record the KEV `dateAdded` and `knownRansomwareCampaignUse` field value in the clearance table.

Audit findings go into the plan's `tech-docs.md` Security Clearance Status table, or for ad-hoc bumps outside a plan, into the PR description.

## Cutoff Date Computation

For every bump, the policy author MUST state the cutoff date in writing:

```
Today: <YYYY-MM-DD>
Cutoff: today − 60 days = <YYYY-MM-DD>
Eligible (Path B): versions released on or before <cutoff>
```

This ensures auditability when CVE or release dates are revisited.

## When the Plan Spans Many Days

If a plan with dependency bumps takes more than 60 days to merge, the cutoff drifts forward. Re-run the eligibility check before the final merge to catch newly-eligible versions or newly-disclosed CVEs.

## Examples

### Example 1: Path A (LTS, Recent Patch)

Node.js: `package.json` `volta.node` = `"24.13.1"`. Released within 30 days before the bump. LTS Krypton confirmed. CVE-clean per NVD. **Decision: keep at the latest LTS patch** — LTS path overrides the 60-day rule.

### Example 2: Path B (Non-LTS, Eligible Older Version)

Tailwind CSS: latest is 4.3.0 (released 7 days ago). Cutoff = today − 60 days. Latest version released on or before the cutoff is 4.2.1. 4.2.1 is CVE-clean. **Decision: bump to 4.2.1** — skip 4.3.0; it is not eligible until 60 days have elapsed.

### Example 3: Path C (Waiver)

mermaid: latest is 11.15.0 (released 4 days ago). All versions below 11.15.0 have unpatched CVE-2026-41148 (CSS injection, High 7.1) and five related CVEs. No pre-cutoff CVE-clean version exists. **Decision: waiver — pin to 11.15.0.** Justification: required for active CVE patches; 60-day rule waived per Path C.

## Application Workflow

When proposing or executing a dependency bump, follow these steps in order:

1. List every package, runtime, and base image to be bumped
2. For each item: classify as Path A, B, or C
3. For Path A: identify the latest LTS patch and verify CVE clearance
4. For Path B: identify the latest version released on or before the cutoff and verify CVE clearance
5. For Path C: document the waiver per the template above
6. Apply Rule 5a (recency): confirm the chosen version is the most recent eligible one for its path
7. Apply Rule 5b (functional stability): confirm the chosen version is not yanked/deprecated and has no open release-blocker for its primary function — if it fails, fall back to the most recent eligible version that passes and record a `FUNCTIONAL-HOLD`
8. Convert all version specs to exact pins (remove carets and tildes)
9. Run lockfile updates: `npm install`, `go mod tidy`, `cargo update -p <pkg>`
10. Run security re-audit: `npm audit --audit-level=moderate`, `govulncheck ./...`
    10a. Cross-reference every CVE from steps 3–5 against the CISA KEV feed: `curl -s https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/feeds/known_exploited_vulnerabilities.json | jq '.vulnerabilities[] | select(.cveID=="CVE-YYYY-NNNNN")'`. Record `dateAdded` and `knownRansomwareCampaignUse` for any matches; append `(KEV-listed)` to the clearance status in the plan's `tech-docs.md`.
    10b. Query EPSS for any CVE with CVSS ≥ 7.0: `curl -s "https://api.first.org/data/v1/epss?cve=CVE-YYYY-NNNNN"`. Record the score and percentile in the clearance table. If score ≥ 0.5, flag for expedited scheduling (EPSS Escalation applies).
11. Document the audit results and any waivers in the plan's `tech-docs.md`
12. Run quality gates for affected projects: typecheck, lint, test:quick, spec-coverage

## Tools and Automation

- **repo-rules-checker** — validates that any plan introducing dependency bumps includes a Security Clearance Status section and applies the three-path decision tree
- `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` — mandatory post-update security scan for npm packages
- `govulncheck ./...` — mandatory post-update security scan for Go modules
- `grep -E '"\^|"~'` — pin verification after any `package.json` edit
- Renovate / Dependabot — if configured, surface bump PRs but require human application of the three-path classification before merge
- **CISA KEV JSON feed** — `https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/feeds/known_exploited_vulnerabilities.json` — daily-updated catalog of CVEs with confirmed active exploitation; cross-reference with `jq '.vulnerabilities[] | select(.cveID=="CVE-YYYY-NNNNN")'`
- **FIRST.org EPSS API** — `https://api.first.org/data/v1/epss?cve=CVE-YYYY-NNNNN` — daily ML exploitation-probability score (0–1) for any given CVE; supports comma-separated batch lookups
