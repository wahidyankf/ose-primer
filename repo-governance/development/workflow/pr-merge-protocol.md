# PR Merge Protocol

Merging a pull request requires a set of hardened preconditions to hold — not a per-instance prompt. Once they hold, `[AI]` merges by default; a `[HUMAN]` merge gate applies only where a plan's own step says so explicitly. All quality gates must pass before merge, and bypassing them without explicit user permission is forbidden.

## Principles Implemented/Respected

This practice respects the following core principles:

- **[Deliberate Problem-Solving](../../principles/general/deliberate-problem-solving.md)**: Merging a PR is an irreversible integration action that changes the state of the trunk for every contributor. It demands a deliberate readiness judgment -- which this protocol makes explicit and checkable as preconditions, rather than leaving it to an agent's discretion in the moment.

- **[Root Cause Orientation](../../principles/general/root-cause-orientation.md)**: When quality gates fail, the correct response is to investigate and fix the root cause, not to bypass the gate and merge anyway. This convention ensures that failing gates are treated as problems to solve, not obstacles to circumvent.

- **[Explicit Over Implicit](../../principles/software-engineering/explicit-over-implicit.md)**: Merge authority must rest on explicit, checkable state. "The review cycles felt thorough enough" -- an agent's implicit readiness judgment substituting for the stated preconditions -- is the silent assumption this convention forbids. The merge actor is likewise explicit: `[AI]` by default, `[HUMAN]` only where a plan says so.

- **[Automation Over Manual](../../principles/software-engineering/automation-over-manual.md)**: Quality gates (typecheck, lint, test:quick, specs:coverage, CI workflows) run automatically, and the merge decision is derived from their outcome rather than re-litigated by hand each time. Encoding readiness as preconditions is what makes automating the merge safe.

## Conventions Implemented/Respected

This practice implements/respects the following conventions:

- **[Code Quality Convention](../quality/code.md)**: The quality gates enforced by this protocol (typecheck, lint, test:quick, specs:coverage) are the same gates enforced by the pre-push hook. This convention extends the same standard to the PR merge boundary.

- **[Trunk Based Development Convention](./trunk-based-development.md)**: `worktree-to-pr` -- a short-lived plan branch pushed to a PR -- is the repo-wide default TBD flavor. PRs also exist for `main-to-pr`, code review, and external contributions. This protocol governs the merge step for all of them.

- **[Git Push Safety Convention](./git-push-safety.md)**: Both conventions treat irreversible git operations as gated rather than routine. They differ in the gate: `git push --force` and friends require explicit, per-instance user approval because no automated check can establish their safety, whereas a PR merge's safety **is** mechanically checkable -- so this convention gates on preconditions instead of a prompt.

## The Rule

**AI agents and automation MUST NOT merge a pull request until the hardened preconditions hold.**

A PR merges only when **all five** hold:

- **(a)** the configured `pr-review-maker` → `pr-review-fixer` cycles are complete (default 3) **and
  the review loop did not exit `escalated`** — see
  [Loop-Exit and Escalation Rules](../../workflows/pr/pr-review-quality-gate.md#loop-exit-and-escalation-rules).
  An `escalated` exit blocks the merge on its own, for **any** merge actor, and no combination of the
  other four preconditions discharges it;
- **(b)** 0 CRITICAL and 0 HIGH findings are outstanding;
- **(c)** the branch is up-to-date with the latest `origin/main`, brought forward
  **non-destructively** if behind (never a shared-history rewrite);
- **(d)** all PR quality gates are green (see Quality Gates below);
- **(e)** the surface-conditional tester gates have been run and their defect findings resolved, or
  the exemption is explicitly recorded.

For every PR merge -- without exception -- the agent must:

1. Confirm all five preconditions hold.
2. Surface the PR status, including which gates passed and how each precondition was satisfied.
3. Execute the merge -- `[AI]` is the default actor.

**A `[HUMAN]` merge gate is an explicit per-plan opt-in**, applying only where a plan's own step
says so. When a plan declares one, the agent stops at step 2 and hands off the ready-to-merge PR.
**The preconditions are identical either way -- only the actor differs.** See
[Plans Organization Convention §Delivery Mode](../../conventions/structure/plans.md#delivery-mode).

**Preconditions are evaluated per merge.** Satisfying them for one PR says nothing about the next;
each PR is assessed from zero against the full set.

## Quality Gates

All of the following quality gates must pass before a PR is eligible for merge:

| Gate               | Tool           | What It Validates                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **typecheck**      | Nx affected    | Type correctness across affected projects          |
| **lint**           | Nx affected    | Static analysis, formatting, accessibility         |
| **test:quick**     | Nx affected    | Unit tests, build smoke tests, coverage thresholds |
| **specs:coverage** | Nx affected    | Gherkin step definitions match feature files       |
| **CI workflows**   | GitHub Actions | All configured CI checks for the repository        |

### No Bypass Without Explicit Permission

Bypassing any quality gate without explicit user permission is **forbidden**. This includes:

- Merging with failing CI checks
- Merging with unresolved review comments (unless the user explicitly dismisses them)
- Using admin override to bypass branch protection rules
- Merging with pending required status checks

If the user explicitly says "merge despite the failing lint check" (or equivalent), the agent may proceed -- but only for that specific instance and only for the specific gates the user named.

## When This Applies

This protocol applies whenever a pull request exists as part of the development workflow:

- **`worktree-to-pr` (repo-wide default)**: every plan delivered without an explicit mode override
  resolves to this mode -- a short-lived plan branch, a draft PR opened against `main`, and this
  protocol at merge time. See [The `worktree-to-pr` Terminal Step](#the-worktree-to-pr-terminal-step)
  below for the full terminal-step sequence.
- **`main-to-pr`**: primary-checkout work still routed through a PR follows the same protocol.
- **External contributions**: PRs from external contributors follow this protocol.
- **Code review workflow**: Any short-lived branch created for review purposes follows this protocol.

This protocol does **not** apply to:

- Direct commits under `worktree-to-origin-main` or `main-to-origin-main` (no PR exists to merge).
- Environment branch deployments managed by CI (e.g., `prod-crud-fs-ts-nextjs`), which are governed by their own documented CI workflows.

## The `worktree-to-pr` Terminal Step

Under the repo-wide `worktree-to-pr` default (see the
[Plans Organization Convention — Delivery Mode](../../conventions/structure/plans.md#delivery-mode) and
the [Trunk Based Development Convention](./trunk-based-development.md#default-delivery-mode-worktree-to-pr)),
the AI's work on a plan branch does not end at "all commits pushed." The terminal step, run by `[AI]`,
is:

1. Run the **PR-Review Maker→Fixer Cycle**
   (`repo-governance/workflows/pr/pr-review-quality-gate.md`) -- sequential review/fix cycles
   against the open PR, driving it toward a fully reviewed, green state.
2. Confirm the **done-definition** is met:
   - The review cycle has completed its configured number of passes.
   - Every inline review comment has a reply (resolved or explicitly addressed).
   - All quality gates are GREEN -- both local (pre-push hook) and CI.
   - Archival-in-PR is committed -- the plan folder's archival move lands in the same PR.
3. Flip the PR from draft to ready for review (`gh pr ready`).

**This done-definition is the AI's done-boundary.** Meeting it means the AI's work on the plan is
complete -- it does **not** by itself mean the plan is merged. The merge is a separate, subsequent
action gated on the five preconditions in [The Rule](#the-rule) above, performed by `[AI]` unless the
plan declares a `[HUMAN]` gate. "Done" is not "merged" -- the merge sits outside the done-boundary
entirely.

### Draft PR Lifecycle

Per the [Trunk Based Development Convention](./trunk-based-development.md#why-draft-not-ready-for-review-on-open),
every PR opened under `worktree-to-pr` or `main-to-pr` is **opened as a GitHub draft**
(`gh pr create --draft`), not as a ready-for-review PR. This protocol's precondition gate fires at the
moment the AI flips the draft to ready for review (having met the done-definition above), not at PR
open time.

**Lifecycle**:

1. **Draft opened** -- `[AI]` runs `gh pr create --draft --base main ...`. No precondition gate yet. CI may still run on the draft.
2. **Iterate on the branch** -- `[AI]` pushes additional commits and runs the PR-Review Maker→Fixer Cycle. The PR stays in draft status throughout iteration. No precondition gate yet.
3. **`[AI]` flips to ready** -- once the done-definition is met, `[AI]` runs `gh pr ready` (or marks it ready in the GitHub UI). **This is where the PR Merge Protocol precondition gate fires.** The agent must:
   - Verify all quality gates have passed (see Quality Gates above).
   - Verify all five preconditions in [The Rule](#the-rule) hold.
   - Surface the PR status and how each precondition was satisfied.
4. **The merge** -- `[AI]` by default, once the preconditions hold; `[HUMAN]` only where a plan's own step declares that gate. This step is outside the AI's done-boundary either way.

An agent that opens a draft PR is **not** authorized to merge it on readiness alone --
flipping to ready is the deliberate signal that the AI's own work is done, and the merge follows only
from the preconditions, never from the agent's own judgment that the PR looks finished.

## Agent Workflow

### Before Merging

Before merging, the agent must confirm **all five** hardened preconditions (a)-(e) hold, as stated in
[The Rule](#the-rule) above and defined normatively in
[the PR Review Quality Gate](../../workflows/pr/pr-review-quality-gate.md#hardened-merge-preconditions).
Do not substitute the shorter list that used to live here.

1. **(a)** The review cycles are complete **and the loop did not exit `escalated`** — an escalated
   exit blocks the merge by itself, whatever the other four preconditions say.
2. **(b)** 0 CRITICAL and 0 HIGH findings outstanding, verified against the PR's own diff rather than
   against thread-resolution state.
3. **(c)** The branch is non-destructively up to date with the target branch (no merge conflicts).
4. **(d)** All quality gates are green — local gates and CI — as of the PR's current head commit.
5. **(e)** The surface-conditional tester gates have been run and their findings resolved, or a
   no-reachable-behavior exemption is explicitly recorded.

> **Why this list is spelled out in full.** It previously carried only three items — CI completed,
> review comments checked, branch up to date — because it ran immediately before a **human approval
> prompt**, and the human was the backstop for whatever the list omitted. Now that `[AI]` merges by
> default, that backstop is gone and this is the last checklist an autonomous merge passes through.
> An enumeration that was merely incomplete has become the thing standing in for a reviewer. Any
> future edit must keep it congruent with (a)-(e); never shorten it.

### The Precondition Summary

When all preconditions hold, the agent presents a clear summary, then merges:

```
PR #42: feat(auth): add email validation

Quality gates:
  typecheck:     PASSED
  lint:          PASSED
  test:quick:    PASSED
  specs:coverage: PASSED
  CI workflows:  PASSED

Preconditions:
  (a) review cycles:     3/3 complete
  (b) CRITICAL/HIGH:     0 / 0 outstanding
  (c) branch vs main:    up to date (fast-forwarded, no rewrite)
  (d) quality gates:     all green (above)
  (e) tester gates:      run, findings resolved

Merging PR #42.
```

Where a plan declares a `[HUMAN]` merge gate, the agent prints the same summary and stops, handing
off the ready-to-merge PR instead of merging.

### When Gates Fail

If any quality gate fails, the agent must:

1. Report which gate failed and the error details.
2. Investigate the root cause.
3. Fix the issue (not bypass the gate).
4. Re-run the gates.
5. Only then re-evaluate the merge preconditions.

```
PR #42: feat(auth): add email validation

Quality gates:
  typecheck:     PASSED
  lint:          FAILED (3 errors in auth-validator.ts)
  test:quick:    PASSED
  specs:coverage: PASSED

I will investigate and fix the lint errors before merging.
```

## 📋 Examples

### ✅ Correct agent behavior -- preconditions hold, `[AI]` merges

```
Agent: All five merge preconditions hold for PR #42:

  (a) review cycles:  3/3 complete
  (b) CRITICAL/HIGH:  0 / 0 outstanding
  (c) branch vs main: up to date
  (d) quality gates:  all green
  (e) tester gates:   run, findings resolved

Merging PR #42.
```

### ✅ Correct agent behavior -- plan declares a `[HUMAN]` gate

```
Agent: All five merge preconditions hold for PR #42. This plan's
       delivery checklist declares a [HUMAN] merge gate, so I am
       handing off rather than merging.

       PR is ready to merge: https://github.com/.../pull/42
```

### ❌ Incorrect agent behavior -- merging before the preconditions hold

```
Agent: I created PR #42 and CI is green. Merging now.
[merges after 1 of 3 review cycles -- precondition (a) unmet]
```

### ❌ Incorrect agent behavior -- merging with failing gates

```
Agent: PR #42 has a failing lint check, but the rest passed.
       Merging anyway to save time.
[merges despite failing gate -- precondition (d) unmet]
```

### ❌ Incorrect agent behavior -- merging through a declared `[HUMAN]` gate

```
Agent: All preconditions hold, so I merged PR #43.
[the plan's own step declared a [HUMAN] merge gate; the default does not override it]
```

### ❌ Incorrect agent behavior -- carrying a bypass forward

```
User: [earlier] Merge PR #42 anyway despite specs:coverage.
Agent: [later, different PR] Reusing that bypass to merge PR #43.
```

### ✅ User explicitly bypasses a gate

```
Agent: PR #42 has all gates passing except specs:coverage, which
       failed because the new endpoint's Gherkin scenario is still
       being drafted in a follow-up task.

User: Merge it anyway, I will add the Gherkin scenario in the next commit.

Agent: Understood. Merging PR #42 with your explicit approval to
       bypass the specs:coverage gate for this instance.
```
