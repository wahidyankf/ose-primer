# No Destructive Git Operations Convention

This convention governs **local** git operations that destroy data or rewrite shared state. Its
companion, the [Git Push Safety Convention](./git-push-safety.md), owns the **remote** side —
force-push and hook-bypass approval. Together they cover both directions; neither is sufficient alone.

## The Same-Machine Assumption

Assume the repository is **very active** and that other AI agents, software engineers, and background
processes are working **simultaneously on the same physical machine** — sharing its disk, its git
object database, its refs, its worktrees, and its self-hosted CI runners.

That assumption is what makes these operations dangerous rather than merely blunt. A hard reset in a
solo checkout costs you your own uncommitted work. The same command on a shared machine can discard
work that belongs to someone who never consented to the operation and has no way to recover it — git
keeps no undo history for changes that were never committed.

## Principles Implemented/Respected

- **[Deliberate Problem-Solving](../../principles/general/deliberate-problem-solving.md)**: Every
  operation listed below is irreversible or rewrites state others depend on. The convention prefers
  reversible moves and requires a deliberate, per-instance decision before an irreversible one.

- **[Root Cause Orientation](../../principles/general/root-cause-orientation.md)**: Reaching for a
  hard reset, a force delete, or a recursive clean is nearly always a symptom — a diverged branch, a
  failing gate, a confused working tree. The convention redirects to the cause instead of normalizing
  the destructive shortcut.

- **[Explicit Over Implicit](../../principles/software-engineering/explicit-over-implicit.md)**:
  "Nobody else is working right now" is an implicit assumption an agent cannot verify. The convention
  replaces it with explicit scoping: operate on paths and worktrees you can positively account for.

## Conventions Implemented/Respected

- **[Git Push Safety Convention](./git-push-safety.md)**: The remote-side companion. Force-push and
  hook-bypass operations require explicit, fresh, per-instance user approval there; this convention
  applies the same standard to local destruction.

- **[Worktree Toolchain Initialization](./worktree-setup.md)**: Establishes the worktree as the unit
  of isolation. This convention states what must never be done to a worktree that is not your own.

## Forbidden Operations

Forbidden without explicit per-instance approval. Grouped by what they destroy.

**The table is illustrative, not exhaustive — read the rule first.** _Any_ git invocation whose effect
is to destroy work you did not create, discard uncommitted changes, rewrite published history, or
remove the means of recovering any of those, is forbidden without explicit per-instance approval —
whether or not its spelling appears below. Naming a flag is a convenience for recognising the common
cases; it is never the boundary of the rule. `git switch --discard-changes`, `git checkout -f`,
`git update-ref -d`, `git worktree prune`, `git branch -M` over an existing ref, and any future
spelling that achieves the same effect are all covered by the sentence above despite being absent
from the table. If you are reasoning about whether your command is "on the list," you are asking the
wrong question — ask what it destroys and whether you created it.

| Operation                                                          | What it destroys                                                | Use instead                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `git push --force` (bare)                                          | Others' commits on the remote tip                               | `--force-with-lease=<ref>:<expect>` + `--force-if-includes` |
| `git push --force-with-lease` (bare, no expected value)            | Same, when the local fetch is stale                             | The explicit `=<ref>:<expect>` form                         |
| `git rebase` / `git commit --amend` of **published** commits       | Downstream contributors' history                                | `git revert` (a new inverse commit)                         |
| `git filter-repo` / `git filter-branch`                            | All history, for everyone                                       | Scoped revert; coordinate out-of-band                       |
| `git reset --hard`                                                 | Uncommitted work, irrecoverably                                 | `git stash push` (keep, never drop), or commit first        |
| `git clean -fd` / `-fdx`                                           | Untracked files recursively, including ignored build output     | `git clean -n` to preview; delete named paths               |
| `git stash drop` / `git stash clear`                               | Stash entries, which then become prunable                       | Leave entries; they cost nothing                            |
| `git branch -D`                                                    | A branch, skipping the merged-check                             | `git branch -d` (merged-check retained)                     |
| `git reflog expire --expire=now --all` + `git gc --prune=now`      | The recovery path itself, plus concurrent-write corruption risk | Let git's automatic maintenance run                         |
| `git worktree remove --force` (single or doubled)                  | Another actor's working tree and its uncommitted contents       | Non-force `git worktree remove`                             |
| `rm -rf <worktree>`                                                | The worktree, leaving orphaned administrative state behind      | `git worktree remove`; `git worktree repair` if moved       |
| `git checkout -- <path>` / `git restore <path>` over unstaged work | Unstaged edits at those paths                                   | Commit or stash first, then restore                         |

Two behaviors deserve their own statement because they are easy to misread as safe:

- **Bare `--force-with-lease` is not the safe form.** The lease is checked against whatever the local
  ref says, so a stale fetch can satisfy it. Per
  [git-push(1)](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push), supplying the option without an expected value
  "interacts very badly with anything that implicitly runs `git fetch` … this is trivially defeated if
  some background process is updating refs in the background" — precisely the shared-machine case.
- **`--prune=now` is documented as corruption-risking under concurrency.** Per
  [git-gc(1)](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gc), running gc concurrently with another process "may
  corrupt the repository if the other process later adds a reference to the deleted object."

## Cross-Worktree Facts

Git already enforces much of this. State the mechanics so agents cooperate with the tool rather than
fighting it.

- The **object database and `refs/*` are shared** across all worktrees; **`HEAD` and the index are
  per-worktree**. Concurrent checkouts of _different_ branches therefore do not collide by design —
  isolation is real, and does not need to be manufactured.
- Git **already refuses** to check out a branch that is active in another worktree. Note the exact
  mechanism: bare `-f` / `--force` does **not** bypass this guard, but a dedicated
  `--ignore-other-worktrees` flag exists that does. **Do not pass it.**
- Because the object store and refs are shared, `gc`, aggressive pruning, and forced worktree removal
  can affect state another worktree depends on **even though the working trees are isolated**.

## Whole-Tree Staging Is Forbidden

Stage **explicit paths only**. On a shared machine another actor's uncommitted work, scratch files,
and half-finished edits sit in the same tree. A whole-tree stage sweeps them into _your_ commit —
both a correctness bug (your commit now contains changes you did not author and cannot defend in
review) and a disclosure risk (it is how an unrelated credential-adjacent or scratch file gets
committed by accident, into a history that is permanent).

The rule is therefore stated as a **shape**, not as one flag spelling. Blocking `-A` alone would just
redirect the habit to the next spelling. All of the following are forbidden without explicit
per-instance approval:

- `git add -A` and its long form `git add --all`
- `git add .` — and any bare-directory add that pulls in paths you did not author
- `git add -u` / `--update` across the whole tree
- `git commit -a` / `--all`, which stages every tracked modification implicitly
- any wrapper, alias, or agent shortcut whose net effect is "stage everything"

**Required instead:**

1. Run `git status --porcelain` **first** and read every line.
2. Stage only the paths you can account for: `git add <path> [<path>...]`. Anything you cannot
   account for belongs to another actor and stays unstaged.
3. In a sibling repo or another worktree, use the `-C <worktree>` form —
   `git -C <worktree> add <path>` — so the operation cannot leak into the wrong tree.

The cost is a few named paths. The failure it prevents is committing someone else's work, or a
secret, into a history that cannot be rewritten without coordinating with everyone who has pulled it.

## No Corner-Cutting — Root-Cause Orientation Is Binding

Under parallel execution the cheapest way to make a gate go green is to weaken the gate. When a gate,
test, lint, type-check, or CI job fails, **fix the cause, never the signal**.

Forbidden without explicit per-instance approval **and** a written reason recorded in the plan. As
with the Forbidden Operations table above, **this list is illustrative, not exhaustive** — _any_
action whose effect is to make a failing signal pass without addressing what it reported is covered,
whether or not its form appears here:

- bypassing hooks (`--no-verify`) or skipping a declared quality gate
- deleting, skipping, `.only`-narrowing, or loosening a failing test instead of fixing the code
- weakening an acceptance criterion, threshold, or lint rule so a failing check passes
- ticking a delivery checkbox without the evidence its acceptance criterion demands
- suppressing an error — a broad catch, an ignore-comment, a silenced warning — in place of a fix
- deferring a discovered preexisting failure instead of fixing it in-scope

A blocker that genuinely cannot be root-caused within scope is **escalated and recorded** — named in
the plan, with what was tried and why it is out of scope — never silently worked around. Escalating is
a legitimate outcome; quietly routing around is not.

The distinction that matters: each item above makes the _report_ green without making the _system_
correct. A suppressed error still fires in production; a narrowed test still leaves the untested path
broken; an unticked-but-ticked checkbox transfers a false completion signal to whoever reads the plan
next. On a shared machine that false signal is what another actor builds on.

## Prefer Additive, Own-Worktree Operations

Two habits prevent most of the above from ever arising:

- **Additive over destructive.** A new commit that reverses a change is recoverable; a rewrite that
  erases it is not. When both reach the same end state, take the one that leaves a trail.
- **Your own worktree only.** Operate within the worktree this unit of work created. Acting on a
  worktree you did not create requires positive evidence it is idle — not the absence of evidence
  that it is busy.

Before a long unattended run, `git worktree lock --reason=<why>` makes the intent legible to whoever
looks next. Before any bulk delete, `-n` / `--dry-run` costs nothing.
