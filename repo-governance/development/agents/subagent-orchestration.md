# Subagent Orchestration Convention

## Introduction

This document defines how a main agent manages subagents it spawns via the Agent tool: how many to run in parallel, how to poll for stuck agents, and what signals distinguish healthy from stalled execution. These standards prevent Claude API per-minute rate-limit failures and ensure stuck agents are detected and relaunched rather than silently starving a batch.

## Principles Implemented/Respected

This practice implements/respects the following core principles:

- **[Deliberate Problem-Solving](../../principles/general/deliberate-problem-solving.md)**: Concurrency caps and polling cadences are deliberate, pre-decided constraints — not reactive responses. The main agent acts from a bounded model rather than spawning speculatively and hoping the API absorbs it.

- **[Root Cause Orientation](../../principles/general/root-cause-orientation.md)**: Stuck detection addresses the root cause (output-token-budget exhaustion during planning, causing silent stall) rather than the symptom (batch never completing). Relaunch restores completion; ignoring a stall compounds delay.

- **[Simplicity Over Complexity](../../principles/general/simplicity-over-complexity.md)**: A single default N (3 background subagents, N+1 total including the main thread) with a clearly-described adjustment path is simpler than an adaptive scheduler — one number to reason about, deliberately set rather than continuously inferred. Three minutes between polls is a single number to remember. Concrete mtime-based stuck detection requires no additional tooling.

- **[Explicit Over Implicit](../../principles/software-engineering/explicit-over-implicit.md)**: The cap, polling interval, and stuck threshold are explicit constants stated in this document. Agents do not infer limits from context; they apply the values here.

## Conventions Implemented/Respected

This practice respects the following conventions:

- **[Content Quality Principles](../../conventions/writing/quality.md)**: This document follows active voice, proper heading hierarchy, and accessible examples throughout.

- **[File Naming Convention](../../conventions/structure/file-naming.md)**: This document uses a lowercase kebab-case filename consistent with repository naming rules.

The following Layer 3 development practice also informs this document:

- **[Agent Workflow Orchestration Convention](./agent-workflow-orchestration.md)**: Subagent orchestration is a specialization of delegated agent strategy. The rules here narrow the delegation model for the case where agents run in background.

## Purpose

When a main agent uses the Agent tool to spawn multiple subagents in background (`run_in_background: true`), it operates with incomplete information about each subagent's progress. Two failure modes are common:

1. **Rate-limit collisions**: Each subagent has its own context window and tool-call stream. Running too many simultaneously saturates the model vendor's per-minute API quota, causing retries, degraded throughput, or hard failures.

2. **Stuck agents**: A subagent occasionally stalls — usually because its output-token budget is exhausted mid-plan. The agent "completes" but its output file is sparse or ends with a planning sentence (e.g., "Now writing section...") rather than finished content. Without polling, the main agent waits indefinitely.

This convention codifies two interlocking standards that address both failure modes.

## Scope

### What This Convention Covers

- Maximum concurrent Agent-tool spawns from a single main agent
- Polling cadence and signals for stuck detection
- How to identify healthy vs. stalled subagent output
- Relaunch procedure when a stuck agent is detected
- Chunk sizing guidance to fit within healthy runtimes
- Per-session override rules

### What This Convention Does NOT Cover

- Subagent internal behavior (covered by [Agent Workflow Orchestration Convention](./agent-workflow-orchestration.md))
- Agent frontmatter or file structure (covered by [AI Agents Convention](./ai-agents.md))
- Workflows that call agents sequentially rather than in background (no special rules needed)
- Bash-based tool parallelism (distinct from Agent-tool spawning)

## Standards

### Standard 1 — Default Concurrency: N Background Agents (N+1 Total Including Main Thread)

The main agent MUST NOT have more than **N background subagents active simultaneously**, where **N defaults to 3**. The main thread's own execution is the `+1` and does not consume one of the N slots, but it is never idle while background subagents run — it is always one of the concurrently active agents. Counting the main thread, **at most N+1 agents are concurrently active in total** (four at the default N). When independent units of work are ready, background slots should be kept full up to N rather than running them one at a time.

**Applies to**: All Agent-tool spawns, whether background or foreground. Both content-producing makers (e.g., `apps-ayokoding-www-by-example-maker`) and meta-agents (e.g., `repo-rules-maker`) count toward N. Total simultaneous background Agent-tool invocations is the metric, not agent type.

**Background-slot preference**: prefer to fill the background slots up to N and keep the **main thread vacant** — the main thread is the responsive **orchestrator**, background agents are the **workers**. A user who asks a question mid-batch should not have to wait behind the main thread's own long-running work. This preference is **bounded by the DAG**: fan out only genuinely independent nodes. Never split dependent work artificially just to raise slot utilization — a serialized dependent chain running at one slot is correct, not a failure to parallelize.

**Rationale**: Each subagent operates its own independent tool-call stream against the model vendor's API. Running more background subagents than the machine and budget can absorb risks saturating the per-minute request quota and increases token burn rate, producing rate-limit errors that cascade and slow the entire batch — this is a token-starvation and rate-limit concern, not merely a throughput cap. N=3 is chosen to **bound token/compute-budget burn** while still delivering meaningful parallel throughput. Assume the machine is **shared**: other agents, engineers, and processes are running concurrently against the same disk, git object store, and CI runners, so the safe N is bounded by what that shared machine can absorb alongside them. This is the concrete subagent specialization of the broader parallel-by-default working norm — see [Parallel-by-Default Practice](../practice/parallel-by-default.md) for the general principle.

**Sequencing rule**: Launch a new subagent only after a prior one completes (via task-notification message) or after calling `TaskStop` on a stuck agent. Do not pre-queue more than N pending background launches at once.

**Adjustment rule**: N is adjustable per-plan and along the way — raised when independent work, machine capacity, and budget headroom all allow, and **lowered when required** under budget, runner, or disk pressure. A plan declares its chosen N in its `## Parallelization Model` section. The main agent MUST NOT silently self-promote beyond the declared N based on its own assessment of available headroom.

#### Examples

```
PASS: N-1 background agents active, another independent unit is ready → launch it (keep slots full)
PASS: N background agents active → wait for one to complete → launch next
PASS: Plan declares N=5 for a wide independent batch → 5 background agents active for that plan
PASS: Disk pressure on the shared machine → lower N for the rest of the batch
PASS: Two dependent nodes remain → run them serially even though slots are free (DAG governs)
FAIL: More than the declared N launched simultaneously
FAIL: Main agent raises N on its own because "the first few seem fast"
FAIL: Splitting one dependent chain into fake parallel units to fill idle slots
```

### Standard 2 — 3-Minute Stuck-Detection Polling

When subagents run in background (`run_in_background: true`), the main agent MUST poll every **3 minutes** to verify no agent has stalled.

#### Polling Mechanism

The poll inspects **target file mtime and size** — the output file each subagent is producing. The main agent reads file metadata (not file contents) to check for progress.

**MUST NOT read transcript files**: The Agent tool writes a transcript to a temp path (e.g., `/private/tmp/...output`). Reading this file via shell overflows the main agent's context window, per harness convention. Transcript files are off-limits for polling. Use only the known output file path that the subagent was instructed to write.

#### Stuck Threshold

A subagent is considered **stuck** when either of these conditions holds:

- The output file mtime has not changed for **30 minutes or more** since the last observed change (or since launch if never observed to change)
- No task-notification completion signal has arrived within approximately **3× the runtime of peer agents** that completed successfully in the same batch

The 30-minute mtime threshold is empirically grounded: healthy subagents update their output file within 3–10 minutes of launch when chunk size is appropriate. A 30-minute gap with no mtime change reliably distinguishes stalled from slow.

#### Recovery Procedure

When a stuck agent is detected:

1. Call `TaskStop` with the agent's `agentId` (obtained from the Agent-tool spawn response)
2. Relaunch the same agent with the same prompt and output path
3. Log the relaunch in the batch tracking state (e.g., `local-temp/todo.md`) so the main agent can detect if the same agent stalls a second time
4. If a relaunched agent stalls again, reduce the chunk size and relaunch with narrower scope

**Why relaunch works**: The stuck condition is almost always caused by output-token-budget exhaustion during the agent's internal planning phase. The agent consumes its token budget reasoning about structure before generating output, leaving little budget for the actual content. Relaunch starts fresh with full token budget; the agent typically completes normally because it encounters fewer planning branches on a familiar task.

#### Healthy vs. Stuck: Empirical Signal Table

| Signal                                       | Healthy                                    | Stuck                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| First mtime change after launch              | Within 3–10 min                            | Never, or after 30+ min                                    |
| Output file size growth                      | Grows steadily across polls                | Flat across multiple polls                                 |
| Task-notification arrival                    | Within 3–10 min after peer agents complete | Absent long after peers complete                           |
| Final output content (post-completion check) | Complete section                           | Ends mid-sentence or with planning text ("Now writing...") |

#### Examples

```
PASS: Poll at 3-min intervals → agent A mtime updated at t+5min → healthy
PASS: t+30min, agent B mtime unchanged → TaskStop(agentB.id) → relaunch → completes
FAIL: Main agent waits indefinitely for task-notification without polling
FAIL: Main agent reads /private/tmp/...output to check progress → context overflow
FAIL: Main agent polls every 30 seconds → excessive tool-call overhead
```

### Standard 3 — Chunk Sizing for Background Agents

Chunk the work assigned to each background subagent so that expected runtime stays within **3–10 minutes per agent**. This keeps the batch observable, limits blast radius if an agent stalls, and fits within healthy output-token budgets.

**Empirical guidance**: 7 examples per chunk (for content-generating agents processing example pages) observed to produce 3–10 minute runtimes with 2 parallel languages (the current background cap). Adjust chunk size down if a category of agent stalls repeatedly; adjust up (cautiously) if completion times are consistently under 2 minutes.

**Rule**: When a relaunched agent stalls a second time on the same chunk, split the chunk in half and relaunch the two halves as sequential (not parallel) agents.

### Standard 4 — Agent ID and Task-Notification Handling

The Agent tool returns an `agentId` for each spawn. The main agent MUST:

- Record each `agentId` alongside the expected output file path in its tracking state
- Use `agentId` with `TaskStop` when stuck detection triggers
- Use `SendMessage` (not file polling) to relay new instructions mid-run if needed

Task-notification messages from the harness signal completion (or kill). These are the primary completion signal. File mtime polling is the secondary stuck-detection signal, not a substitute for task-notifications.

`TaskList` does NOT show spawned Agent IDs. The only source of an Agent ID is the response from the Agent-tool spawn call. The main agent must preserve these IDs in local tracking state (e.g., `local-temp/todo.md`) for the duration of the batch.

## Anti-Patterns

### Launching a Full Batch Without Waiting

**Problem**: The main agent launches all subagents simultaneously to minimize total elapsed time.

**Why it fails**: More than N concurrent background agents (N+1 total including the main thread) saturates the per-minute API quota and increases token burn rate. Rate-limit errors cascade; agents that would have succeeded fast must retry, extending total batch time beyond the sequential baseline. On a shared machine the same overshoot also starves the other agents and engineers working against the same disk and runners.

**Fix**: Hold background agents at the declared N (N+1 total including the main thread; N defaults to 3). Launch the next agent only after one completes.

### Relying Solely on Task-Notifications for Stuck Detection

**Problem**: The main agent waits for task-notification completion signals and takes no other action.

**Why it fails**: A stuck agent may never emit a completion notification. The batch blocks indefinitely.

**Fix**: Poll file mtime every 3 minutes. Apply the 30-minute stuck threshold. Call `TaskStop` when triggered.

### Reading the Transcript File to Check Progress

**Problem**: The main agent reads the `/private/tmp/...output` transcript file via shell to diagnose a slow agent.

**Why it fails**: The transcript file is large and grows with every tool call. Reading it overflows the main agent's context window, degrading reasoning quality for all subsequent work in the session.

**Fix**: Poll the output file mtime only. If content verification is needed post-completion, read only the relevant sections of the output file.

### Self-Promoting the Concurrency Cap

**Problem**: The main agent raises the cap to 3 or 4 background agents on its own judgment because early agents are completing quickly.

**Why it fails**: Completion speed varies. A batch that starts fast can become rate-limited as all agents hit their tool-intensive middle sections simultaneously. The default N is set deliberately at 3 background agents (N+1 total including the main thread) — balancing parallel throughput against API headroom and token/compute-budget burn — to stay safely below the saturation threshold at all batch phases.

**Fix**: Hold at the declared N background agents (N+1 total including the main thread; N defaults to 3). N is adjusted deliberately — per-plan or along the way — never self-promoted by the main agent mid-batch.

### Running Background Work Serially

**Problem**: The main agent runs background subagents one at a time — waiting for the first to finish before launching the second — even when two independent units of work are ready simultaneously.

**Why it fails**: Serial execution wastes available throughput. If two units are independent and a second background slot is free, holding it empty doubles elapsed time for no benefit.

**Fix**: Keep all background slots full up to the cap of two. When a slot frees and independent work is waiting, launch immediately.

### Monolithic Chunks Assigned to Single Agents

**Problem**: The main agent assigns 20 or 30 examples to a single background agent to minimize spawning overhead.

**Why it fails**: Large chunks produce long-running agents that either exhaust their output-token budget mid-way (causing the stuck condition) or require the main agent to wait a long time before observing any output. When they stall, the entire chunk must restart.

**Fix**: Target 3–10 minute runtime per agent. Size chunks empirically for each agent type.

## Tooling Reference

| Tool             | Purpose in This Convention                                     |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Agent`          | Spawns subagent; returns `agentId`                             |
| `TaskStop`       | Terminates stuck agent by `agentId`                            |
| `SendMessage`    | Sends new instructions to a running agent                      |
| `TaskList`       | Lists TaskCreate tasks — does NOT show Agent IDs               |
| `ScheduleWakeup` | Schedules the main agent's next poll (use 180-second interval) |

**Note**: `ScheduleWakeup(delaySeconds=180)` is the preferred mechanism for 3-minute polling cadence. This is consistent with the pattern established by [CI Monitoring Convention](../workflow/ci-monitoring.md) for other scheduled checks.
