# Repository Dependency Bump Planning Workflow

**Purpose**: Turn the [Dependency Bump Stability & Safety Policy](../../development/workflow/dependency-bump-policy.md)
into a concrete, validated **backlog plan** for updating dependencies across the whole monorepo
(`apps/`, `libs/`, workspace-root pins, `.opencode/`, `infra/`, and the CI toolchain pins under
`.github/`). This workflow performs the policy's survey-and-classify work (Application Workflow steps
1–7: inventory → path classification → recency → functional stability → clearance) and hands the
results to `plan-planning` to author the plan.

> **The outcome is the plan, not the implementation.** This workflow never edits a manifest,
> never updates a lockfile, and never runs a bump. It produces a proposal in `plans/backlog/`. The
> actual edits happen later, only after a human promotes the backlog plan to `plans/in-progress/`
> and runs the [Plan Execution workflow](../plan/plan-execution.md). The policy's Application
> Workflow steps 8–12 (pin, lockfile, re-audit, document, quality gates) become the plan's
> delivery checklist — they are executed then, not now.

This is a `planning`-type workflow (per the
[Workflow Naming Convention](../../conventions/structure/workflow-naming.md) Type Vocabulary): a
single forward procedure whose terminal deliverable is a plan document. It is **not** an iterative
quality gate.

## Execution Mode

**Direct Orchestration** — the calling context (top-level assistant session) orchestrates the
phases, delegating external version/CVE/yank research to `web-researcher` via the Agent tool,
running the human checkpoint inline (so the user's conversation is preserved), and invoking the
[plan-planning workflow](../plan/plan-planning.md) for plan
authoring.

## When to use

- Periodic dependency-hygiene sweep across the monorepo (e.g., a scheduled maintenance cadence).
- Before a release, to capture a snapshot proposal of all eligible bumps for later scheduling.
- When a runtime/language LTS line advances and you want a planned, policy-compliant upgrade.

## Phases

### 0. Pre-flight (Sequential)

**Actions**:

- Confirm the repository working tree is clean (`git status --porcelain` empty).
- Resolve `as-of-date` (input, else current date). Compute and record the Path B cutoff:
  `cutoff = as-of-date − 60 days`. This is written verbatim into the clearance report per the
  policy's [Cutoff Date Computation](../../development/workflow/dependency-bump-policy.md) section.
- Resolve `scope-filter` and `ecosystems`. Default scope = every dependency-bearing manifest in
  the monorepo: `apps/` and `libs/` project manifests, the workspace-root language pins,
  `.opencode/package.json`, per-project `rust-toolchain.toml`, `infra/` container definitions, and
  the CI toolchain pins under `.github/`.

**Output**: Cutoff date computed. Scope resolved.

**On failure**: If the tree is dirty, abort and ask the user to commit/stash first.

### 1. Inventory (Sequential)

Enumerate every in-scope dependency manifest and capture its currently-pinned versions. Manifests
governed by the policy (intersected with `scope-filter`/`ecosystems`) in `ose-primer`:

- **npm**: workspace-root `package.json` (`volta` block = Node/npm language pins; `dependencies`,
  `devDependencies`, `optionalDependencies`), `apps/*/package.json`, `libs/*/package.json`, and the
  `.opencode/package.json` binding manifest.
- **Cargo**: `apps/crud-be-rust-axum/Cargo.toml` and `apps/rhino-cli/Cargo.toml`
  `[dependencies]`, plus each project's `rust-toolchain.toml` compiler-channel pin.
- **.NET**: `apps/crud-be-csharp-aspnetcore/**/*.csproj` and `apps/crud-be-fsharp-giraffe/**/*.fsproj`
  `<PackageReference>` entries. The .NET SDK version IS pinned per-app via a `global.json` in each
  of `apps/crud-be-csharp-aspnetcore/` and `apps/crud-be-fsharp-giraffe/` — inventory both.
- **Go**: `apps/crud-be-golang-gin/go.mod` and `libs/golang-commons/go.mod`
  Go version + module requirements.
- **Docker**: `FROM` base-image tags in **all** Dockerfiles (`apps/*/Dockerfile*` and
  `infra/dev/**/Dockerfile*`) plus the `image:` references in `apps/*/docker-compose*.yml` and
  `infra/**/docker-compose*.yml`.
- **GitHub Actions**: three pin classes under `.github/`, all governed by the policy —
  (1) **composite-action input defaults** that pin language/toolchain versions
  (`.github/actions/setup-*/action.yml` defaults for node, dotnet, golang, jvm, python, flutter,
  clojure, elixir, rust); (2) **inline version pins** set directly in workflow YAML
  (e.g. `node-version: "24"` in `.github/workflows/*.yml`); and (3) **third-party action `uses:`
  references** in `.github/workflows/*.yml` and `.github/actions/*/action.yml` (e.g.
  `actions/checkout@v4`, `volta-cli/action@v4`, `Swatinem/rust-cache@v2`).

Use the `nx-workspace` skill / `nx graph` to enumerate projects, then `Grep`/`Glob` for the
manifests (including `.github/`, `infra/`, and root config files). Record a table: source →
ecosystem → package → current pinned version.

**Output**: Full inventory of in-scope dependencies with current versions.

**Note**: This scope mirrors the policy's [What This Policy
Covers](../../development/workflow/dependency-bump-policy.md) list, which already governs all
Dockerfile `FROM` lines, GitHub Actions `uses:` references, and composite-action input defaults.
Lockfiles (`package-lock.json`, `Cargo.lock`, `go.sum`) and workspace-internal `*` references stay
out of scope per that same policy section.

### 2. Candidate Discovery & Classification (Parallel, delegated)

For each dependency/runtime, determine its policy path and the version to propose. Delegate the
external research to `web-researcher` — the [default primitive for public-web information
gathering](../../conventions/writing/web-research-delegation.md). **Group research by ecosystem**
(one agent per ecosystem batch) rather than one agent per package, and fan out under the **N+1
model** — `1 main thread + N background agents = N+1 total`, default **N=3** — per the
[Subagent Orchestration Convention](../../development/agents/subagent-orchestration.md). Ecosystem
batches are independent DAG nodes (no batch reads what another writes), so the number of batches is
the actual fan-out and N only caps it.

Each research batch must return, per package:

- Latest version and its release date; whether an LTS line exists (→ **Path A**) and the latest
  LTS patch.
- For non-LTS packages, the latest version released on or before the **cutoff** (→ **Path B**).
- CVE status across all five policy sources (NVD, GitHub Security Advisories, Snyk DB, vendor
  security page, **CISA KEV**). If no version satisfies both the 60-day rule and CVE-cleanness →
  **Path C**.
- **CISA KEV check**: cross-reference every CVE against the [CISA KEV JSON feed](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/feeds/known_exploited_vulnerabilities.json).
  If any unpatched CVE affecting the current pin is KEV-listed, **KEV Fast-Track** applies —
  escalate immediately to Path C regardless of soak eligibility. Record `dateAdded` and
  `knownRansomwareCampaignUse` for each match.
- **EPSS score**: for any CVE with CVSS ≥ 7.0, query `https://api.first.org/data/v1/epss?cve=CVE-YYYY-NNNNN`
  and record the score (0–1) and percentile. If score ≥ 0.5, flag for expedited scheduling
  (EPSS Escalation rule).
- **Rule 5a (recency)**: the most recent eligible version for the chosen path.
- **Rule 5b (functional stability)**: whether the chosen version is yanked/deprecated, carries an
  open release-blocker, or has a widely-reported fatal functional bug — and if so, the most recent
  eligible version that passes.

**Agent**: `web-researcher` (one invocation per ecosystem batch).

**Output**: Per-package classification: path (A/B/C), proposed target version, CVE status, Rule 5b
status.

### 3. Clearance Table & Decisions (Sequential)

Assemble the results into the policy's **Security & Functional Clearance Status** for every
package, using one of: `CLEAR`, `CLEAR (patch-of)`, `WAIVER`, `FUNCTIONAL-HOLD` (per the policy).
Append the `(KEV-listed)` suffix to any status where the CVE appears in CISA KEV.

Build the proposed bump table with columns:
**project → package → current → proposed → path → KEV-listed → EPSS score → clearance**

Record the cutoff computation from Phase 0. Mark any KEV Fast-Track escalations prominently
(e.g., `Path B → Path C (KEV Fast-Track)`) so the human checkpoint can review them first.

Write all of this progressively to
`generated-reports/repo-dependency-bump-planning__<uuid>__<YYYY-MM-DD--HH-MM>__report.md`
(the `clearance-report` output) per the [Temporary Files convention](../../development/infra/temporary-files.md).

**Output**: `clearance-report` written. Bump table + clearance statuses finalized.

### 4. Human Checkpoint (Sequential, Hard Gate)

Present the proposed bump table, the clearance statuses, and — prominently — any `WAIVER`,
`FUNCTIONAL-HOLD`, or `(KEV-listed)` rows. KEV Fast-Track escalations and EPSS ≥ 0.5 flags
MUST appear at the top of the summary before other rows. Use `AskUserQuestion` to:

1. Confirm the plan identifier (default `dependency-bump`).
2. Confirm the scope is correct (any packages to exclude/hold).
3. Explicitly approve proceeding to plan authoring.

**Do NOT proceed to Phase 5** until the user approves. The user may trim scope or defer specific
bumps here.

**Output**: Approved bump set + confirmed identifier.

### 5. Backlog Plan Planning (Sequential)

Invoke the [plan-planning workflow](../plan/plan-planning.md) to
author the plan, then relocate the result into `plans/backlog/`.

> **Repository adaptation**: `ose-primer`'s `plan-planning` has **no `target-stage`
> input** — it always writes the plan to `plans/in-progress/<identifier>/`. This workflow's
> deliverable is a **backlog** plan, so after establishment completes you MUST relocate the plan to
> the backlog stage. Do not pass a `target-stage` argument; it is not supported.

Procedure:

1. Invoke `plan-planning` with:
   - **Input** `push-target`: forwarded from this workflow's input.
   - **Input** `prompt`: a self-contained handoff containing the full inventory, the approved bump
     table, the Security & Functional Clearance Status, the recorded cutoff date, a link to the
     `clearance-report`, and the **Definition of Done** below. The handoff MUST instruct the plan
     author to use the confirmed `plan-identifier` as the plan-folder slug.
2. After establishment lands the plan at `plans/in-progress/<identifier>/`, relocate it to the
   backlog stage (backlog uses no date prefix per the
   [Plans Organization Convention](../../conventions/structure/plans.md)):

   ```bash
   git mv plans/in-progress/<identifier> plans/backlog/<identifier>
   ```

   Update the plan's `## Worktree` path and any self-references to the new folder name, then update
   `plans/in-progress/README.md` (remove the entry) and `plans/backlog/README.md` (add the entry).

3. Commit the relocation and push to `push-target`.

**Definition of Done** for the plan it must author:

- Every in-scope manifest is pinned (exact, no `^`/`~`) to its approved target version.
- Lockfiles regenerated (`npm install`, `cargo update -p`, `go mod tidy`, etc.).
- Post-bump re-audit clean (`npm audit --audit-level=moderate`, `govulncheck ./...`).
- Post-bump CISA KEV cross-reference clean (no remaining KEV-listed CVEs in pinned versions).
- All `WAIVER`/`FUNCTIONAL-HOLD`/`KEV-listed` entries propagated to `docs/reference/security-waivers.md` with KEV and EPSS columns populated.
- Affected-project quality gates pass (typecheck, lint, test:quick, specs:coverage).
- The delivery checklist mirrors the policy's [Application Workflow](../../development/workflow/dependency-bump-policy.md)
  steps 8–12, grouped per ecosystem, TDD-shaped where code changes are required.

Because `plan-planning` runs its own grill + (optional) research + `plan-maker` +
`plan-quality-gate` + push, this phase yields a strict-gate-passing plan that this workflow then
parks in `plans/backlog/`.

**Output**: `plan-path`, `final-status`, `final-report` (from the nested quality gate).

### 6. Hand-back (Sequential)

Emit a user-visible summary: `plan-path`, `clearance-report` path, `final-status`, and a reminder
that **the plan is a snapshot as of the cutoff date**. Per the policy's
[When the Plan Spans Many Days](../../development/workflow/dependency-bump-policy.md) section, if
promotion to `in-progress/` is delayed, the eligibility check must be re-run before execution to
catch newly-eligible versions or newly-disclosed CVEs.

## Gherkin Success Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: repository dependency bump planning

Scenario: Planning sweep produces a backlog plan without touching manifests
  Given the repository working tree is clean
  When the workflow runs to completion
  Then a clearance report appears under generated-reports/repo-dependency-bump-planning__*__report.md
  And a plan exists at plans/backlog/dependency-bump/
  And the backlog plan passes plan-quality-gate at strict mode
  And no package.json, Cargo.toml, rust-toolchain.toml, go.mod, *.csproj, *.fsproj, global.json, Dockerfile, docker-compose*.yml, .github/ action.yml/workflow, or lockfile is modified

Scenario: Functional-hold is surfaced before authoring
  Given a candidate version is yanked or carries an open release-blocker
  When the workflow classifies that package
  Then the clearance report records it as FUNCTIONAL-HOLD with the skipped and chosen versions
  And the human checkpoint presents the FUNCTIONAL-HOLD before plan authoring

Scenario: User declines at the checkpoint
  Given the proposed bump table is presented
  When the user does not approve
  Then no plan is authored
  And the workflow terminates with the clearance report written
```

## Principles Implemented/Respected

- **[Deliberate Problem-Solving](../../principles/general/deliberate-problem-solving.md)**: Classification and clearance precede any proposal; the human checkpoint forces an explicit go/no-go.
- **[Explicit Over Implicit](../../principles/software-engineering/explicit-over-implicit.md)**: Cutoff date, path classification, and clearance status are recorded in writing before the plan is authored.
- **[Reproducibility First](../../principles/software-engineering/reproducibility.md)**: The resulting plan mandates exact pins and lockfile regeneration.
- **[Automation Over Manual](../../principles/software-engineering/automation-over-manual.md)**: Inventory, research, and clearance assembly are delegated and report-driven.
- **[No Time Estimates](../../principles/content/no-time-estimates.md)**: Outcomes, not durations.

## Conventions Implemented/Respected

- **[Workflow Naming Convention](../../conventions/structure/workflow-naming.md)**: Basename `repo-dependency-bump-planning` parses as scope=`repo`, qualifier=`dependency-bump`, type=`planning`.
- **[Plans Organization Convention](../../conventions/structure/plans.md)**: The backlog plan uses the `<identifier>/` folder form (no date prefix).
- **[Web Research Delegation Convention](../../conventions/writing/web-research-delegation.md)**: Version/CVE/yank research delegated to `web-researcher`.
- **[Subagent Orchestration Convention](../../development/agents/subagent-orchestration.md)**: Research agents fan out under the N+1 model — `1 main thread + N background agents = N+1 total`, default N=3 — with the main thread kept vacant as orchestrator and N never self-promoted beyond the declared value.
- **[Linking Convention](../../conventions/formatting/linking.md)**: Cross-references use GitHub-compatible markdown with `.md` extensions.
