goal: >
  Run spec-aware exploratory testing and spec-blind heuristic-usability testing against the same

  separated (exploratory EWT-### vs usability UWT-###) and which carries a tech-docs.md (root-cause +
  fix approach), a TDD-shaped delivery.md describing how to fix every finding, and — when the plan is
  UI-bearing — an assets/ folder of both-tier (lo-fi + hi-fi) UI mockups. The deliverable is the

# Web Exploratory and Usability Test-Fixing Planning Workflow

**Purpose**: Test a live website from two complementary angles in one pass — spec-aware exploratory
(`web-exploratory-tester`) and spec-blind heuristic-usability (`web-usability-tester`) — then fold
both result sets into a single fix-ready plan whose findings stay attributed to their source and
which spells out, in `tech-docs.md` and a TDD-shaped `delivery.md`, exactly how to fix what was found.

> **The outcome is the plan, not the implementation.** This workflow never edits app/lib source,
> never runs a fix, and never lands behaviour changes. It produces a proposal under
> `plans/in-progress/`. The actual fixes happen later, only after a human reviews the plan and runs
> the [Plan Execution workflow](../plan/plan-execution.md). `delivery.md` becomes the executable
> checklist then, not now.

This is a `planning`-type workflow: a single forward procedure whose terminal deliverable is a plan
document. It is **not** an iterative quality gate over the site.

## Execution Mode

**Agent Delegation (preferred)** — the calling context orchestrates the phases, delegating the two
testing passes to `web-exploratory-tester` and `web-usability-tester` via the Agent tool **one at a
time** (exploratory first, integrate, then usability, integrate), running the solidification and
plan authoring through `plan-maker`, and gating with `plan-checker` / `plan-fixer`. The human grill
checkpoint runs inline so the user's conversation is preserved.

**Manual Orchestration (fallback)** — when those agents are unavailable as delegated agent types,
the assistant executes each phase directly using the testers' and plan agents' documented procedures
with Read/Write/Edit tools.

## When to use

- You have a running site (dev, preview, or production) and want both a correctness sweep and a
  first-time-user usability read, delivered as one actionable fix plan rather than two disconnected
  reports.
- Before hardening a user-facing feature: capture defects and friction together so the fix plan
  addresses both in one delivery checklist.
- To refresh an existing findings plan: re-run both testers and merge the new results into the
  prior plan folder (`plan-mode=merge`).

## Grilling (Human Checkpoints)

This workflow **grills the user hard whenever a decision is genuinely needed** — it never guesses a
material choice. Every grill question is asked with the `AskUserQuestion` tool as a multiple-choice
prompt per the
[Grilling-With-Options Convention](../../development/workflow/grilling-with-options.md), and every
question always offers the standing options required by that convention (a blank-state / "none of
these" type answer **and** a "let's chat about this" escape hatch). Grill only when the answer
changes what the workflow does; when a sensible default exists, take it and state it.

Decision points that trigger a grill:

- **Pre-flight** — ambiguous or multi-candidate target URLs; `plan-mode` (new vs merge) when not
  given; the new-plan `plan-identifier`; which `locales`/`breakpoints` to cover when the target is
  multi-locale or the responsive scope is unclear.
- **After both passes are integrated (entering Phase 3)** — which findings are in scope vs deferred;
  prioritization/severity disputes; the **fix approach** where more than one valid option exists;
  whether to accept each exploratory `SG-###` as a specs addition.
- **UI direction (UI-bearing plans)** — which low-fidelity alternative advances to high-fidelity, and
  which high-fidelity finalist is selected (the design-funnel decision), grilled before the
  `.excalidraw.png` finalists are committed.
- **Before push** — confirm the `push-target` when it differs from the default.

The Phase 3 `plan-maker` invocation performs its own before/after grill as part of authoring; this
section governs the workflow-level checkpoints around it so no material decision is made silently.

## Phases

### 0. Pre-flight (Sequential)

**Actions**:

- Confirm the `ose-public` working tree is clean (`git status --porcelain` empty).
- Verify every URL in `target-urls` returns HTTP 200 (curl). If the server is down, abort and ask
  the user to start it — the testers cannot run against a dead target.
- Resolve `plan-mode`. For `new`, resolve `plan-identifier` (input, else derive from the target,
  e.g. `ayokoding-www-calc-test-fixing`). For `merge`, require `target-plan-path` to point at an
  existing folder under `plans/in-progress/`; abort if absent.
- Resolve `breakpoints` and `locales` (defaults = testers' own standard coverage; `locales` defaults
  to ALL locales the target supports — discovered from the app's i18n config or locale-prefixed
  routes — never just the default locale).

**Output**: Targets reachable; plan destination resolved.

**On failure**: Dirty tree → ask the user to commit/stash first. Unreachable URL or missing
merge target → abort with a clear message.

### 1. Exploratory Pass + Integrate (Sequential, delegated)

Run the spec-aware tester **first, alone**, then fold its results into the plan before the usability
pass starts. It is **non-destructive / passive** — it reads, clicks, resizes, and probes but never
mutates server state.

**Agent**: `web-exploratory-tester` — spec-aware. Compares live behaviour against existing
`specs/**` Gherkin; actively hunts edge cases and boundary conditions; produces a findings catalog
`EWT-###` (functional, behavioural-consistency, edge-case/boundary, UI/UX, responsive, accessibility,
URL/IA, passive security) plus spec-gap proposals `SG-###` (Gherkin scenarios for correct-but-unspecced
behaviour, edge cases especially).

- **Args**: `target-urls: {input.target-urls}`, `testing-goal: {input.testing-goal}`,
  `breakpoints: {input.breakpoints}`, `locales: {input.locales}`.
- **Output**: Returns its full findings set as structured text (README/brd/prd/findings/spec-gaps
  bodies). Subagents cannot write under `plans/` directly, so the orchestrator captures the returned
  text.

**Integrate**: Establish the plan skeleton under `plan-path` (or, for `plan-mode=merge`, open the
existing folder) and write the Exploratory half: a `## Exploratory findings (EWT-###)` section in
`findings.md`, the `spec-gaps.md` proposals, and the exploratory slice of README/brd/prd. Preserve
the tester's original IDs.

**Success criteria**: Exploratory findings (possibly empty) integrated into the plan.
**On failure**: If the tester fails, record the gap prominently in the plan README and proceed to
Phase 2 with the usability perspective only — never silently drop a perspective.

### 2. Usability Pass + Integrate (Sequential, delegated)

Only after Phase 1 has integrated, run the spec-blind tester and fold its results into the **same**
plan. Also passive / non-destructive.

**Agent**: `web-usability-tester` — spec-blind. Deliberately ignores specs/source/mockups; judges
only first-time-user perception against Nielsen's 10 heuristics (0–4 severity), cognitive walkthrough,
information scent, edge-case UX states (empty/zero-result/loading/error), and responsive usability;
produces a findings catalog `UWT-###`. Emits no spec-_gaps_ (gap analysis requires reading the specs,
which it refuses), but MAY emit `USS-###` **spec-suggestions** — Gherkin scenarios for behaviour a
first-timer expects but the page lacks, each flagged as a spec-blind candidate for reconciliation.

- **Args**: same as Phase 1.
- **Output**: Returns its findings + `walkthrough` + any `USS-###` spec-suggestions as structured text.

**Integrate**: Add a **separate** `## Usability findings (UWT-###)` section to `findings.md` and the
`walkthrough.md` transcript, merge the usability slice into README/brd/prd, and add a short
**cross-reference note** flagging where an EWT and a UWT describe the same underlying defect (e.g. the
`html lang="en"` locale issue both will catch) so the shared root cause is fixed once. The findings
of the two sources MUST remain in their own labelled sections — a reader must always be able to tell
an exploratory finding from a usability finding. Carry the usability tester's `USS-###`
**spec-suggestions** into the plan's spec coverage too — keep them labelled as spec-blind suggestions
distinct from the exploratory `SG-###` spec-gaps, and let the Phase 3 grill decide which to accept into
`specs/**`.

**Success criteria**: Both findings sections present and source-attributed in one `findings.md`;
`SG-###` and `USS-###` spec proposals captured and kept distinct.

### 3. Solidify — tech-docs, delivery, and (conditional) UI assets (Sequential, delegated)

With both findings sets integrated, solidify the plan into a fix-ready deliverable.

**Agent**: `plan-maker` — grills the user (multiple-choice, per the
[Grilling-With-Options Convention](../../development/workflow/grilling-with-options.md)) on scope,
prioritization, fix approach, and any UI direction, then authors:

- `tech-docs.md` — root-cause analysis and the chosen fix approach per finding (or per finding
  cluster), naming the affected files/components and the design-system primitives involved.
- `delivery.md` — TDD-shaped delivery checklist (RED/GREEN/REFACTOR per code item, file path +
  verbatim command + acceptance criterion), tagged `[AI]`/`[HUMAN]`, with Phase 0 first and the
  **Specs & Gherkin completeness** coverage steps that fold the exploratory `SG-###` proposals into
  `specs/**` Gherkin (per [feature-change-completeness](../../development/quality/feature-change-completeness.md)).
  For a web-UI plan, the checklist also ends with a **"Rule-15 retest follow-ups"** section: run one
  spec-aware `web-exploratory-tester` round against the running target URL(s) after the fixes land
  and the visual sign-off is recorded, append each finding as a **new unchecked task-list checkbox**,
  and fix/tick each before archival — per the
  [User-Facing Delivery Hardening Convention](../../development/quality/user-facing-delivery-hardening.md)
  (rule 15).
- Finalize `README.md` so its risk summary labels each top risk `[Exploratory]` or `[Usability]`,
  and the document map lists every file including (when present) the `assets/` folder.

**Conditional — UI-bearing gate**: if **any** finding's fix adds or changes a user-facing screen or
component under `apps/`/`libs/`, the plan is **UI-bearing** and MUST carry an `assets/` folder with
the both-tiers mockups required by the
[UI Mockups in Plan Docs convention](../../conventions/formatting/diagrams.md#ui-mockups-in-plan-docs),
exactly as the
[plan-doc-ui-mockup-convention plan](../../../plans/done/2026-06-16__plan-doc-ui-mockup-convention/assets)
does:

- **Tier 1 (low-fidelity)** — ASCII/Unicode wireframes inline, plus a `ui-<screen>-low-fi-alternatives.md`
  capturing the design-funnel divergence for each changed screen.
- **Tier 2 (high-fidelity)** — `assets/ui-<screen>-option-<x>-<name>.excalidraw.png` for the
  finalists, referenced from `tech-docs.md`/`delivery.md` via `./assets/...png` with descriptive alt
  text. Mobile, tablet, and desktop are all designed (mobile-first); a desktop-only mockup fails.
- **Grounding (R5)** — build every mockup from the existing `libs/ts-ui` kit, the target app's
  shell/theme/i18n, and sibling screens; name any net-new component explicitly. Mockup colors use
  design-system tokens (`bg-primary`, `text-destructive`), never raw hex.

If **no** finding touches UI, the plan is non-UI and the `assets/` folder is omitted (the
convention's exemption for non-UI plans applies).

**plan-mode handling**:

- **new**: the full document set lands at `plans/in-progress/<plan-identifier>/`.
- **merge**: new findings are appended to `target-plan-path` by ID continuation (never renumber prior
  findings); prior findings are re-verified as STILL-PRESENT / FIXED with the result recorded; then
  `tech-docs.md`, `delivery.md`, and any `assets/` mockups are extended to cover the new findings.

**Output**: Complete plan document set under `plan-path`; `exploratory-findings-count` and
`usability-findings-count` tallied.

### 4. Plan Quality Gate (Nested Workflow)

**Workflow**: `plan/plan-quality-gate`

- **Args**: `scope: {plan-path}, mode: {input.mode}`
- **Output**: `{final-status}`

Iterates `plan-checker` → `plan-fixer` to double-zero at the requested mode, confirming the plan's
requirements completeness, technical clarity, and delivery-checklist executability (including the
TDD shape and specs-coverage steps).

**Success criteria**: `plan-quality-gate` returns `pass`.
**On failure**: If it returns `partial` after max-iterations, surface the residual findings to the
user before pushing.

### 5. Push & Hand-back (Sequential)

- Stage the explicit plan paths and the workflow/governance edits only (never `git add -A`; sibling
  repos carry unrelated WIP). Commit with a Conventional Commit message and push to `push-target`.
- Emit a user-visible summary: `plan-path`, `exploratory-findings-count`, `usability-findings-count`,
  `final-status`, and a reminder that the plan is a **snapshot of the site as tested** — re-run both
  testers if the site changes materially before the plan is executed.

**Output**: `plan-path`, `final-status`, pushed commit.

## Gherkin Success Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: web exploratory and usability test-fixing planning

Scenario: One run produces one combined, source-attributed plan
  Given a reachable live URL and a testing goal
  And the ose-public working tree is clean
  When the workflow runs to completion in plan-mode=new
  Then a plan exists at plans/in-progress/<identifier>/
  And the plan contains README.md, brd.md, prd.md, findings.md, tech-docs.md, and delivery.md
  And findings.md has a separate "Exploratory findings (EWT-###)" section and "Usability findings (UWT-###)" section
  And delivery.md is TDD-shaped with Specs & Gherkin coverage steps
  And the plan passes plan-quality-gate at strict mode
  And no file under apps/ or libs/ source is modified

Scenario: Testers run sequentially with incremental integration
  Given a reachable live URL and a testing goal
  When the workflow runs
  Then the exploratory tester runs and its EWT-### findings are integrated into the plan
  And only then does the usability tester run and its UWT-### findings get integrated
  And tech-docs.md and delivery.md are authored after both findings sets are integrated

Scenario: A UI-bearing plan carries an assets folder with both-tier mockups
  Given at least one finding's fix changes a user-facing screen or component
  When the plan is solidified
  Then the plan contains an assets/ folder
  And each changed screen has a low-fidelity ASCII wireframe and a high-fidelity .excalidraw.png finalist
  And mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts are all designed
  And mockup colors use design-system tokens rather than raw hex

Scenario: A non-UI plan omits the assets folder
  Given no finding's fix touches a user-facing screen or component
  When the plan is solidified
  Then no assets/ folder is created

Scenario: Merge mode extends an existing findings plan
  Given an existing plan folder under plans/in-progress/
  When the workflow runs in plan-mode=merge against that folder
  Then prior findings keep their original IDs and gain a re-verification result
  And new findings are appended by ID continuation
  And tech-docs.md and delivery.md are extended to cover the new findings

Scenario: Material decisions are grilled with options
  Given more than one valid fix approach exists for a finding
  When the plan is being solidified
  Then the workflow grills the user with a multiple-choice AskUserQuestion
  And the question offers a blank-state option and a "let's chat about this" option
  And no material decision is made without the user's answer

Scenario: Unreachable target aborts before testing
  Given a target URL that does not return HTTP 200
  When the workflow starts
  Then it aborts in pre-flight with a message to start the server
  And no plan is authored
```

## Principles Implemented/Respected

- **[Deliberate Problem-Solving](../../principles/general/deliberate-problem-solving.md)**: Two independent perspectives are gathered and reconciled before any fix is proposed; the plan-maker grill forces explicit scope decisions.
- **[Explicit Over Implicit](../../principles/software-engineering/explicit-over-implicit.md)**: Findings stay attributed to their source (EWT vs UWT); the fix approach and delivery steps are written down before execution.
- **[Simplicity Over Complexity](../../principles/general/simplicity-over-complexity.md)**: One plan, one delivery checklist — shared root causes are fixed once via the cross-reference note.
- **[Automation Over Manual](../../principles/software-engineering/automation-over-manual.md)**: Testing and authoring are delegated to specialized agents; the gate iterates automatically.
- **[No Time Estimates](../../principles/content/no-time-estimates.md)**: Outcomes, not durations.

## Conventions Implemented/Respected

- **[Workflow Naming Convention](../../conventions/structure/workflow-naming.md)**: Basename `web-exploratory-and-usability-test-fixing-planning` parses as scope=`web`, qualifier=`exploratory-and-usability-test-fixing`, type=`planning`.
- **[Plans Organization Convention](../../conventions/structure/plans.md)**: The plan lands at `plans/in-progress/<identifier>/` with no date prefix.
- **[Feature Change Completeness](../../development/quality/feature-change-completeness.md)**: The delivery checklist carries the specs+Gherkin coverage steps for the exploratory spec-gap proposals.
- **[UI Mockups in Plan Docs](../../conventions/formatting/diagrams.md#ui-mockups-in-plan-docs)**: A UI-bearing plan carries an `assets/` folder with both-tier (lo-fi ASCII + hi-fi `.excalidraw.png`) mobile/tablet/desktop mockups, design-funnel alternatives, grounding rule, and token-only colors.
- **[Grilling-With-Options Convention](../../development/workflow/grilling-with-options.md)**: Every material decision is grilled via `AskUserQuestion` with multiple-choice options plus the standing blank-state and "chat about this" options.
- **[Subagent Orchestration Convention](../../development/agents/subagent-orchestration.md)**: The two testers run sequentially (one at a time), well within the concurrency cap.
- **[Linking Convention](../../conventions/formatting/linking.md)**: Cross-references use GitHub-compatible markdown links with `.md` extensions.
