# Applying Content Quality Standards

## Purpose

This Skill provides comprehensive guidance for applying **universal content quality standards** to all markdown content in the repository. It ensures consistent writing quality, accessibility compliance, and professional presentation across documentation, web sites, planning documents, and root files.

**When to use this Skill:**

- Creating or editing markdown content in docs/
- Writing content for ayokoding-web (Next.js) or oseplatform-web (Hugo)
- Creating planning documents in plans/
- Writing repository root files (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, etc.)
- Ensuring accessibility compliance (WCAG AA)
- Reviewing content for quality standards

## Core Quality Principles

### Writing Style and Tone

**Active Voice Required**: Use active voice for clarity and directness.

✅ **Good**: "The agent validates the content against the convention."
❌ **Avoid**: "The content is validated against the convention by the agent."

**Professional Tone**: Maintain professional, welcoming tone without being overly formal.

**Clarity and Conciseness**: Write clear, direct sentences. Avoid jargon without context.

**Audience Awareness**: Consider reader's technical level and provide necessary context.

### Heading Hierarchy

**Single H1 Rule**: Each markdown file MUST have exactly one H1 heading (# Title).

**Proper Nesting**: Follow hierarchical structure without skipping levels:

- H1 (#) - Document title
- H2 (##) - Major sections
- H3 (###) - Subsections
- H4 (####) - Sub-subsections
- H5/H6 - Use sparingly

❌ **Invalid nesting** (skips level):

```markdown
# Title

### Subsection ← Skips H2!
```

✅ **Valid nesting**:

```markdown
# Title

## Section

### Subsection
```

### Accessibility Standards

**Alt Text Required**: All images MUST have descriptive alt text.

```markdown
✅ ![Architecture diagram showing six-layer hierarchy](./diagram.png)
❌ ![](./diagram.png) ← Missing alt text
```

**WCAG AA Color Contrast**: Text must meet WCAG AA contrast ratios:

- Normal text: 4.5:1 minimum
- Large text (18pt+): 3:1 minimum

**Semantic Formatting**:

- Use **bold** for emphasis, not italics
- Use proper heading structure (not bold text as headers)
- Use lists for list content (not manual bullets)

**Screen Reader Support**: Content must be accessible to screen readers through proper HTML structure and ARIA labels when needed.

### Formatting Conventions

**Code Blocks**: Always specify language for syntax highlighting.

````markdown
✅ Good:

```javascript
const x = 10;
```
````

❌ Bad:

```
const x = 10;  ← No language specified
```

````

**Paragraph Length**: Keep paragraphs concise (≤5 lines for readability).

**Line Length**: Aim for 80-100 characters per line for better readability.

**Lists**: Use consistent formatting:
- Unordered lists: Use `-` (hyphen) for consistency
- Ordered lists: Use `1.` numbering
- Nested lists: Indent with 2 spaces per level

## No Time Estimates

**CRITICAL**: Never include time-based framing in content.

❌ **Forbidden**:
- "This tutorial takes 30 minutes"
- "Complete this in 2-3 weeks"
- "You can do this in 5 minutes"

✅ **Instead**:
- Describe what will be accomplished
- List concrete outcomes
- Let users determine their own pace

**Rationale**: Time estimates create artificial pressure and vary widely by experience level.

## Common Quality Checklist

Before publishing any markdown content, verify:

- [ ] Active voice used throughout
- [ ] Exactly one H1 heading
- [ ] Proper heading nesting (no skipped levels)
- [ ] All images have descriptive alt text
- [ ] Code blocks specify language
- [ ] No time-based estimates or framing
- [ ] Professional, welcoming tone
- [ ] Paragraphs ≤5 lines
- [ ] Clear, jargon-free language (or jargon explained)
- [ ] WCAG AA color contrast for any custom colors
- [ ] Semantic formatting (bold for emphasis, proper lists)

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Missing alt text

**Wrong**: `![](./image.png)`
**Right**: `![Detailed description of image content](./image.png)`

### ❌ Mistake 2: Skipped heading levels

**Wrong**:
```markdown
# Title
### Subsection  ← Skips H2
````

**Right**:

```markdown
# Title

## Section

### Subsection
```

### ❌ Mistake 3: Time-based framing

**Wrong**: "This tutorial takes 30 minutes to complete."
**Right**: "This tutorial covers X, Y, and Z concepts."

### ❌ Mistake 4: Passive voice overuse

**Wrong**: "The file is created by the command."
**Right**: "The command creates the file."

### ❌ Mistake 5: Code blocks without language

**Wrong**:

```
npm install
```

**Right**:

```bash
npm install
```
