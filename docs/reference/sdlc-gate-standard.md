# SDLC Gate Standard

> Source of truth: [`tech-docs.md`](../../plans/in-progress/standardize-rhino-cli-sdlc-parity/tech-docs.md)

This document defines the target standard for SDLC gate mechanics across all three OSE repositories:
`ose-public`, `ose-primer`, and `ose-infra`. **Identical gate mechanics** means the same check set,
the same order, and the same invocation mechanism across all three repos. The only sanctioned variation
is the project/app set (and therefore the per-app deploy/CRON workflows and language-specific gate
jobs). See [Divergence Policy](#divergence-policy) for the exact boundary.

## Lifecycle Stages

This section is the single normative reference for what runs, in what order, at every SDLC stage.
After the standardization plan the command list below is byte-identical across `ose-public`,
`ose-primer`, and `ose-infra` (only the affected project set differs, since `nx affected` resolves per
repo). Each stage names the surface file and the exact command sequence.

| Stage                | Surface                                 | Trigger                       |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1. pre-commit        | `.husky/pre-commit`                     | `git commit` (before message) |
| 2. commit-msg        | `.husky/commit-msg`                     | `git commit` (on the message) |
| 3. pre-push          | `.husky/pre-push`                       | `git push`                    |
| 4. PR quality gate   | `.github/workflows/pr-quality-gate.yml` | pull request (+ branch push)  |
| 5. main quality gate | `.github/workflows/main-ci.yml`         | push to `main` (post-merge)   |

A standalone `validate-env.yml` workflow runs on `pull_request` and `push:main` in parallel with the
PR and main gates. No CRON pipeline is part of the gate set; `test:integration`, `test:e2e`, and
`deps:audit` (all uncacheable or heavy) run only in scheduled CRON pipelines, never in any gate.

### Command Scope

Every command carries exactly one of five controlled scope values:

- **affected file-type** — files matching a glob, limited to the changed set (staged at pre-commit;
  `--diff` at PR). For example: lint-staged formatters, tool-lint, per-file markdown validators.
- **all file-type** — files matching a glob, across the whole repo regardless of what changed. For
  example: `md links validate`, `env validate`, and the main-gate lint-staged-equivalent pass.
- **affected projects** — the touched Nx project graph (`nx affected`); per affected project only. For
  example: `test:quick`, structural specs at pre-push and PR.
- **all projects** — every Nx project (`nx run-many --all`). For example: `test:quick` and structural
  specs at the main gate.
- **other** — not file-type or project scoped: the commit-message text, binding regeneration from the
  whole `.claude/` tree, the path-gated governance validators, and the `detect`/`quality-gate` CI
  plumbing.

The same check moves only along this scope axis between gates. For example: lint-staged is
`affected file-type` at pre-commit/PR and `all file-type` at main; `test:quick` is
`affected projects` at pre-push/PR and `all projects` at main.

### Gate Composition Rule

One identity, one carve-out, and two exclusions govern every stage:

1. **`(pre-commit ∪ pre-push) == PR gate == main gate`** — the check set is identical; only the scope
   differs. Every check that runs at pre-commit or pre-push also runs in the PR gate and in
   `main-ci.yml`, and neither CI gate runs any check the two local hooks do not.
   - **pre-commit** — lint-staged checks over the staged files; pre-push's per-project legs over the
     affected graph (`nx affected`).
   - **PR gate** — the same set recomputed server-side on the canonical `origin/main...HEAD` diff
     (lint-staged via `--diff`; per-project via `nx affected`).
   - **main gate** — the same set across every project and all files (`nx run-many --all`;
     lint-staged-equivalent over all files). The one place the whole repo is re-verified green,
     catching main-only/merge-skew breakage the affected graph misses.

2. **Formatting is the sole carve-out.** The lint-staged formatters (`prettier`/`rustfmt`/… write in
   place) are a normalization step, not a pass/fail check: they auto-fix at pre-commit and via the
   PR-branch commit-back, and are not re-run at main (`format:check` is removed plan-wide). Every
   other lint-staged entry — tool-lint and the per-file markdown validators — is a real check and
   appears in all three gates.

3. **Heavy/uncacheable tiers never run in any gate.** Every check in the four gates must be
   Nx-cacheable so the cache can be warmed first and the actual commit/push stays fast.
   `test:integration`, `test:e2e`, and `deps:audit` are CRON-only, never in any gate.

**Gate rule summary**: `(pre-commit ∪ pre-push) == PR gate == main gate` — the check set is identical
across all four; only the scope differs. `test:integration`, `test:e2e`, and `deps:audit` run only in
scheduled CRON pipelines, never in any gate.

Independent checks run in parallel within every stage: CI gates run as parallel GitHub Actions jobs;
local hooks run the per-project `nx affected` leg concurrently with the repo-wide validators
(`md links validate`, `env validate`, governance). Ordering only matters where a real data dependency
exists.

### Stage 1: pre-commit

`.husky/pre-commit`, in this exact order; stops at first failure:

| #   | Command                                            | Scope              | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 4   | (lockfile-sync hook step)                          | affected file-type | Regenerates and re-stages `package-lock.json` for any app whose `package.json` is staged (reproducible-envs guardrail).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Step 1 is `ose-infra`-divergent: it runs `scripts/check-no-env-staged.sh` (a bash script) instead of the
`env staged-guard validate` Rust command shown above — same behavior (rejects any staged real `.env*`
file except `.env.example`), different mechanism. Tracked: task "Port full Phase 1 CLI overhaul to
ose-infra".

Pre-commit is the fast stage — it does not run `test:quick`. Per-project `typecheck`/`lint`/`test:unit`
run at pre-push via `test:quick`, never here.

The tool-linters (`shellcheck`/`hadolint`/`actionlint`) are pure file-type dispatch — exactly what
lint-staged already does for formatters — so they are lint-staged entries, not `nx run` targets. They
stay tool-gated (skip-with-hint when the linter is absent locally — CI is the hard gate).

The `./scripts/git-identity-check.sh` script is removed and replaced by the Git Identity Guardrail: a
behavioral rule, not a mechanical gate. **No AI agent may set or modify git user identity
(`user.name`/`user.email`) at any scope.** Specifically, an agent must not run
`git config --local user.name`/`user.email`, the bare `git config user.name`/`user.email` (which
writes to the local repo config by default inside a worktree), `--global`/`--system` identity, or
edit a `[user]` section in `.git/config`. Commit identity always comes from the developer's own global
config (`~/.gitconfig`, optionally via `includeIf "gitdir:…"` for per-tree identities). This mirrors
the [no-real-.env agent guardrail](../../repo-governance/conventions/security/secrets-and-env-standards.md).
This rule governs interactive agents working in a developer's repo/worktree — it does not forbid a CI
workflow from configuring a service-account/bot identity in its own YAML (for example, the
`github-actions[bot]` identity used by the PR-gate format-commit-back).

### Stage 2: commit-msg

`.husky/commit-msg`. Identical in all three repos:

| #   | Command                              | Scope | What it does                                                                                                                          |
| --- | ------------------------------------ | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | `npx --no -- commitlint --edit "$1"` | other | Validates the commit message against Conventional Commits (`@commitlint/config-conventional`) — scope is the message text, not files. |

### Stage 3: pre-push

`.husky/pre-push`, in this exact order; stops at first failure:

| #   | Command                                                                                                                             | Scope              | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Each governance validator (rows 4–8) is path-gated — invoked only when its trigger path is in the
changed set.

The former separate specs-structural step is gone — all `specs:*` validators now run inside `test:quick`
(step 1) via `test:specs`, which runs in order:

| Nx target (in `test:specs`)  | rhino-cli command                                         | Validates                                                                                                                                                                                              | Applies to                       |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `specs:structure-validation` | `cargo run --release -- specs structure validate`         | The spec tree is structurally valid — merged adoption + tree + counts: the app/lib has adopted BDD (no orphan project), the canonical C4 tree exists, and each required subfolder holds ≥ 1 spec file. | Every project                    |
| `specs:behavior:coverage`    | `cargo run --release -- specs behavior-coverage validate` | Every Gherkin step has a step definition, and every scenario outside `domain/**` is covered at exactly its required levels via explicit `@covers` markers.                                             | Every project                    |
| `specs:domain:coverage`      | `cargo run --release -- specs domain-coverage validate`   | The same coverage model scoped to `domain/**` feature files only.                                                                                                                                      | Projects in `specs.domain-areas` |

(`specs:gherkin-cardinality-validation` is not in `test:specs` — it is a per-file `.feature` check
that runs in lint-staged at pre-commit. Spec-file link integrity is likewise not in `test:specs` — the
repo-wide `md links validate` gate already covers `specs/**.md`.)

jobs differ). `$P` = `$(($(nproc)-1))`.

All jobs run in parallel (matrix + independent jobs); `quality-gate` is the join point. No
`test:integration`/`test:e2e` — same fast set as pre-push, recomputed server-side and widened to cover
everything the two local hooks run.

### Stage 5: Main Quality Gate

`main-ci.yml` (post-merge, on push to `main`). Runs the same job set as the PR gate but across every
project (`nx run-many --all`, not `nx affected`) — the one post-merge place the whole repo is
re-verified green. The governance validators run unconditionally (not path-gated). `$P` = `$(($(nproc)-1))`.

All jobs run in parallel; `quality-gate` is the join point. The check set is identical to the PR gate
(which is itself `pre-commit ∪ pre-push`); the only deltas are scope — `nx run-many --all` instead of
`nx affected`; the lint-staged-equivalent set over all files instead of `--diff`; governance run
unconditionally instead of path-gated.

### Worktree-Agnostic Execution

Every guardrail in this section — the `.husky` hooks, every
`cargo run -- … validate`/`generate` call, `lint-staged`, and the `nx affected`/`run-many` targets
they invoke — must run identically whether launched from the primary checkout (where `.git/` is a real
directory) or a linked worktree under `worktrees/<name>/` (where `.git` is a gitdir-pointer file and
the shared object store and refs live in the common dir).

Concretely: resolve the current tree root with `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` and shared metadata
with `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`; never treat `.git/` as a directory; resolve `repo-config.yml`,
exclude lists, and test fixtures from the current worktree's toplevel, never the main checkout. Husky
hooks invoke via `core.hooksPath`, which linked worktrees inherit from the common dir, so the hooks
fire in a worktree unchanged. `ose-infra` is a bare repo worked only through linked worktrees (no
primary checkout exists), so worktree-agnostic execution is a hard requirement there, not a nicety.

## Target Standard

The gate-check standard is synthesized by picking the strongest wiring per surface, even where that
means changing `ose-public`. The named winner per surface:

## Divergence Policy

Per the identical-result invariant, the standardization layer is identical across all 3 repos. The
only sanctioned variation is what each repo actually ships (its project/app set) and the data that
follows from it. Everything in "Drift" below must converge to one form.

### Allowed Divergence

The following variations are not flagged as drift:

- **App set and per-app deploy CRONs** — `ose-public` ships content/web apps (`ose-www`,
  `ayokoding-www`, `organiclever-www`, `wahidyankf-www`, `*-app-web`, `*-be`); `ose-primer` ships
  polyglot demo backends/frontends; `ose-infra` ships `coralpolyp`. Each repo keeps only the deploy
  CRON workflows for apps it actually ships. `ose-primer`'s `test-and-deploy-*-development.yml`
  workflows are a **no-op deploy leg**: the `crud-*` apps are reference/template scaffolding for the
  polyglot showcase, not live products, so there is no staging/production environment to push to —
  each job runs the full test suite (quick+integration+e2e) via the shared `_reusable-*` workflows and
  stops there. `ose-public`/`ose-infra`'s deploy CRONs push to real Vercel/self-hosted environments.
- **Language gate jobs** — the PR gate's per-language jobs (golang, jvm, dotnet, python, rust, elixir,
  clojure, dart, typescript) exist only for languages present in that repo.
- **Infra-only IaC gates** — `terraform fmt`/`validate`/`tflint`, `ansible-lint`, `yamllint` exist
  only in `ose-infra`, in both hooks and the PR gate.
- **Self-hosted runner labels** — `ose-infra` runs on `[self-hosted, linux, ose-infra-runner]`.
- **lint-staged formatter entries** — only for languages present (for example `*.go`, `*.{ex,exs}`
  exist where that language ships). The common entries (`*.md`, `*.json`, `*.{yml,yaml}`,
  `*.{css,scss}`, `*.rs`, `*.fs`) must match across all repos.

### Drift

The following must converge — this is the work of the standardization plan:

- Workflow **filenames** for the shared gates (PR gate, markdown, env).
- The **validator set** inside the markdown workflow and the specs-gate.
- The **invocation mechanism** for shell/docker/actions lint (inline shell vs. lint-staged file-type
  entry).
- The **pre-push scoped validator set** (governance vendor audit presence).
- The **job skeleton/names** in the PR gate (detect, markdown, naming, env, specs-gate, quality-gate
  sentinel; formatting is lint-staged at commit, not a gate job).
- The **placement** of env validation (standalone workflow vs. folded into the PR gate).
- The **Nx target names** invoked by hooks/CI, and the rhino-cli target set itself: `fmt`/`format:check`
  targets (removed — formatting via lint-staged), shell/docker/actions tool-lint (folded into
  lint-staged, not Nx targets), the env/governance/binding validators run as direct `cargo run` calls
  in gates (not `nx run rhino-cli:` targets), primer's missing structural specs targets.

## Parity Status

Verified 2026-07-01 across `ose-public`, `ose-primer`, `ose-infra` by directly running the acceptance
command for every mechanics row (not by inspecting config alone; corrected same-day after a follow-up
audit found two rows below were marked ✅ while infra's pre-commit still ran `test:quick` in the wrong
stage via a legacy monolith that bypassed lint-staged — both fixed before this table's final pass). ✅ =
byte/behavior-identical across all three; ⚠️ = tracked, non-blocking divergence with a linked follow-up;
allowed-divergence rows (app set, language gates, infra-only IaC, runner labels, lint-staged formatter
entries) are excluded per [Divergence Policy](#divergence-policy).

one `ose-public` run was confirmed via a clean re-run with zero code changes).
