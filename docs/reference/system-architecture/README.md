# System Architecture

> **Note:** This document is a work in progress (WIP/Draft). Content and diagrams are subject to change as the platform evolves.

Comprehensive reference for the Open Sharia Enterprise platform architecture, including application inventory, interactions, deployment infrastructure, and CI/CD pipelines.

## System Overview

Open Sharia Enterprise is a monorepo-based platform built with Nx, containing multiple applications that serve different aspects of the Sharia-compliant enterprise ecosystem. The system follows a microservices-style architecture where applications are independent but share common libraries and build infrastructure.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Monorepo Architecture**: Nx workspace with multiple independent applications
- **Trunk-Based Development**: All development on `main` branch
- **Automated Quality Gates**: Git hooks + GitHub Actions + Nx caching
- **Deployment**: Vercel for static sites and web applications
- **Build Optimization**: Nx affected builds ensure only changed code is rebuilt

## C4 Model Architecture

The system architecture is documented using the C4 model (Context, Container, Component, Code) to provide multiple levels of abstraction suitable for different audiences.

### C4 Level 1: System Context

Shows how the Open Sharia Enterprise platform fits into the world, including users and external systems.

**Key Relationships:**

- **Developers & Authors**: Interact with GitHub (source of truth) to build applications and create content
- **Learners**: Access educational content via Vercel-hosted sites (crud-fs-ts-nextjs, crud-fs-ts-nextjs)
- **GitHub**: Central hub for CI/CD automation and quality gates
- **Vercel**: Automated deployment platform for Next.js applications and web applications
