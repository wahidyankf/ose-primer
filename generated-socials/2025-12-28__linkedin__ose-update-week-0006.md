OPEN SHARIA ENTERPRISE

Week 0006, Phase 0 Update

After last week's cleanup (37 agents, 6 principles, 21 conventions), I spent this week on structure. The kind of work that doesn't ship features, but makes everything else easier to build.

✅ WHERE WE ARE NOW (December 28)

🤖 45 AI agents

Renamed 36 to domain-based naming (docs**checker, apps**ayokoding-fs\_\_general-checker). At a glance, you know exactly what each agent does and where it works.

🧠 10 foundational principles

Added 4 new: Documentation First, Immutability Over Mutability, Pure Functions Over Side Effects, Reproducibility First. Each with full implementation patterns.

📜 24 documentation conventions

Added 3 new standards: Two-Tier Rule Reference Formatting, clarification on bilingual approaches, and linking improvements.

📚 15 development practices

Added 3 guides on Documentation First mandate, Functional Programming with immutable data, and Reproducible Environments using Volta.

⚙️ Workflows enhanced

Added documentation quality gate workflow and standardized naming. Max-concurrency parameter (2 by default) prevents context bandwidth issues.

📚 Tutorial structure standardized

Implemented dual-path organization for programming languages: by-concept for narrative learning, by-example for code-first reference with 75-90 annotated examples.

🏗️ CLI refinements

Improved ayokoding-cli with title generation and navigation corrections. Not everything should be an agent—the CLI provides fast, deterministic automation.

💭 WHY THIS MATTERS

The 36 agent renamings made the codebase self-documenting. docs\_\_checker validates documentation. App-specific agents are clearly marked. This naming convention is now enforced across multiple checkers.

The two-tier reference formatting (link first mention, inline code after) created a consistency point that checkers can validate. Small standards catch real problems.

Not everything should be an agent. Agents excel at validation. For deterministic operations like navigation regeneration? A traditional CLI is better—faster, more predictable, easier to test.

The repository structure finally feels coherent. Six-layer architecture: Vision → Principles → Conventions/Practices → Agents → Workflows. Each layer has a specific job. Still Phase 0, but it's becoming a foundation.

📅 NEXT WEEK

• Policy-as-code governance layer (8 agent families need migration)
• Create Go best practices documentation for internal CLI tooling
• Tighten repository consistency through automation
