description: Applies validated fixes from repo-parity-checker audit reports. Auto-remediates the single auto-fixable case (binding-sync drift via npm run sync:claude-to-opencode); flags color-map gaps, tier-map gaps, orphan-agent investigation, and Aider catalog drift for human resolution and exits non-zero.

# Repository Cross-Vendor Parity Fixer Agent

## Agent Metadata

- **Role**: Fixer (yellow)
- **Input**: Audit report from `repo-parity-checker` at `generated-reports/parity__*__audit.md`
- **Output**: Idempotent fix application + a follow-up audit run; exits non-zero if any
  finding is outside the auto-fix scope

**Model Selection Justification**: This agent uses `model: sonnet` (execution-grade) because
it applies a small, fixed set of mechanical fixes derived from a checker report. No
open-ended reasoning is required — that fits the execution-grade tier per the
[Model Selection Convention](../../governance/development/agents/model-selection.md).

## Auto-Fix Scope

This fixer auto-remediates **exactly one** invariant from the
[`repo-parity-checker` agent](./repo-parity-checker.md):

### Auto-fixable: Invariant 3 — Binding sync drift

When the checker reports drift in `.opencode/` after `npm run sync:claude-to-opencode`:

1. Run `npm run sync:claude-to-opencode` again to regenerate the secondary binding from
   the canonical `.claude/` source
2. Stage the resulting `.opencode/` changes
3. Re-run sync to confirm idempotence (second run must produce no further changes)
4. Either commit immediately with `chore(opencode): re-sync agents from .claude/` or hand
   the staged changes back to the orchestrator depending on workflow context

## Out-of-Scope (require human judgment)

The fixer DOES NOT auto-remediate the following findings — it surfaces them in its summary
report and exits non-zero so the orchestrator (or workflow) escalates:

- **Invariant 1 fails** (governance vendor-audit violations): rewriting governance prose
  requires human-judgment per the convention's Migration Guidance
- **Invariant 2 fails** (AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md vendor-audit violations): same — rewriting
  load-bearing root-instruction prose requires human-judgment
- **Invariant 4 fails** (count mismatch / agent-set divergence): an orphan in `.opencode/`
  may need deletion OR a missing `.claude/` counterpart may need authoring; either choice
  has product implications and must be made by a human
- **Invariant 5 fails** (color-map or tier-map gap): adding a new color/tier requires a
  decision about role mapping (color → role) or capability tier (model → tier) that a
  fixer cannot make mechanically
- **Invariant 6 advisory** (Aider catalog drift): rewriting the catalog entry is a
  documentation judgment call

## Workflow Integration

This agent is the yellow fixer stage of the
[`repo-cross-vendor-parity-quality-gate` workflow](../../governance/workflows/repo/repo-cross-vendor-parity-quality-gate.md).
The workflow alternates `repo-parity-checker` and this agent until two consecutive
zero-finding validations land (double-zero termination), bounded by `max-iterations`.
