## Purpose

Standardize Phase 0 across all plan executions: install dependencies, converge the polyglot
toolchain, establish a test baseline, and resolve ALL preexisting failures — before any plan
phase work begins. Ensures every plan starts from a clean, known-good state.

## Phase 0 Sequence

Execute the following steps in order. Each step must pass before proceeding to the next.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

**Acceptance**: exits 0, `node_modules/` synchronized.

### Step 2: Converge Polyglot Toolchain

```bash
npm run doctor -- --fix
```

**Acceptance**: exits 0 with no unresolved drift. If drift remains after `--fix`, report the
specific tools that could not be auto-fixed and stop — do NOT proceed until drift is cleared.

### Step 3: Baseline Test Run

Run the full test suite for all projects in scope for the current plan. Use `nx affected` if the
plan affects a subset of projects; use `nx run-many -t test:unit` for a full baseline.

Record the exact pass/fail/skip counts:

```
Baseline (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM):
  Projects in scope: [list]
  Passed: N
  Failed: N
  Skipped: N
  Known preexisting failures: [list test IDs or 'none']
```

**Acceptance**: Baseline recorded and emitted as user-visible output.

### Step 4: Resolve Preexisting Failures

For each failure found in Step 3:

1. Investigate root cause
2. Determine if the failure is:
   - **Pre-existing and in-scope** (related to the plan's work area): fix it before Phase 1
   - **Pre-existing and out-of-scope**: document it in the baseline record as "known, out-of-scope"
     and do NOT fix (to avoid unintended scope creep)
3. Re-run failing tests after any fix to confirm resolution
4. Update baseline record

**Acceptance**: No in-scope preexisting failures remain. All out-of-scope failures are documented.

**On persistent failure**: If an in-scope preexisting failure cannot be resolved within Phase 0,
emit a clear stop signal: the plan cannot proceed until the failure is resolved. Surface the
failure details and halt.

## Principles Implemented/Respected

- **[Root Cause Orientation](../../repo-governance/principles/general/root-cause-orientation.md)**:
  Resolve preexisting failures at root cause, not by marking them as "known and ignored"
- **[Reproducible Environments](../../repo-governance/development/workflow/reproducible-environments.md)**:
  `npm install` and `doctor --fix` establish a reproducible starting state
- **[Deliberate Problem-Solving](../../repo-governance/principles/general/deliberate-problem-solving.md)**:
  Understand the baseline before writing new code
